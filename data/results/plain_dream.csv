89662,"I am religious (Christian). I would think that this had happened because God had willed this to occur. I would also maybe think that the close relative or friend may have prayed about this, and that they had wanted to tell me something. I would not think that it was a complete coincidence, especially is it was so sudden.",7,6,7,7,6,1.14
65329,I think they visited me upon their crossing over to the other side. Their soul probably visited each family member/person they cared for in a personal way to provide comfort upon their death. I would accept that dream as closure and assurance that my family member is okay on the other side. It would help me to move on after their death.,6,6,7,7,5,0.96
82023,"Because I did not have a chance to say goodbye, my loved one come back and say goodbye to me. Besides, maybe our relationship in real life is not good enough for both of us to say we love each other and for life wisdom. By telling me indirectly in my dream, it might have been easier. Maybe it is less sad to say goodbye in dream than in real life.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
24208,"I think that how this would happen is they would think of someone when they're right about to die. Maybe they have a choice with which person they want to talk to, and generally I think most people pick the youngest person they can still impart wisdom onto. It's happened to me before. I think that on a bigger scale, I guess cosmically, it happens to show you that you're not alone and that they will be okay despite passing away. That you were in their thoughts and they wanted to say their last goodbye to you before they left.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
90614,I would feel unable to accept the truth. I know they love me but I haven't got a chance to say I love you too to them. The reason I had that dream may be that they really missed me and hoped to see me in the last minute.,3,3,3,5,4,-0.78
50050,I would not think about it much. Past is dead and life goes on. I tend to focus on my current goals than what have been happened in the past. It is the best way to clear my mind from disturbing thoughts that will not be beneficial or efficient in any way possible.,2,2,2,3,4,-1.48
45583,"I think that this happens because they (and God) knew that you needed to hear from them one last time. They are able to pass this message on to you through a dream because this is the best and least upsetting way of reaching you. However, I think it is possible to have these sorts of dreams without the loved one dying. When this occurs, you are less likely to remember/place importance on the dream and advice because it was not made significant by their death. This occurs because you were thinking of them or worrying about them, not necessarily because you are receiving a message from them.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
89912,"Well I'm not sure if I can answer how/why that would happen exactly, but I can give my best guess. I would assume that their arrival in the dream was a sign. I'm not super religious or one to believe in a lot of supernatural phenomena, but I do think everything happens for a reason. Them coming in that dream was probably their way of saying goodbye to you and getting closure.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
85445,"I don't know how and why this happens at all. My guess would be that as I miss my loved one, she also misses me and cares about me, and so before she dies, she actually sends me a message through my dream.",5,4,5,5,4,-0.26
87242,"I'm not one to necessarily believe in higher powers or destiny that may cause this kind of thing, but I do thing people have a pretty strong sense of intuition which may be at play. In a situation like this, I would argue 'you' personally had some sort of subconscious understanding that your loved one might pass and so you materialized this advice yourself as a means of getting closure. There have been times in my life, even recently, similar to this where I was in disbelief that the timing could have been so perfect. But to that end, I still think even in times of weakness or bad health we inherently have some sort of intuition or willpower that allows us to for example hold on until a loved one can see us before we pass.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
76170,"When someone older gives me advice, I try to listen to them and see how I could implement their advice into my life. Often times, my grandmother tells me things that are for my own good, even if I do not think so at that moment. I will say that even though they give me advice, this does not mean I am going to follow it, but I respect their thought, and will consider it. It is also a foreshadowing moment to know that one of their last memories you have of them is about wisdom, and is something you will probably never forget.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
36009,"I think it's a sign form God. God wanted us to feel extra warm towards that person right before we learn of their death to make us feel more connected to them, so we keep them in our thoughts and prayers more, or maybe to make us feel remorseful for not spending more time with them while they were alive. But also to maybe energize us to follow their wisdom since it was the ""last thing"" they said to us before they died.",7,7,7,7,5,1.14
88031,"To me, this would be a weird freak coincidence; I don't believe in religion or a higher power, so I wouldn't attribute it to anything like that. However, there have been multiple times where I have thought about somebody and then seen them shortly after. Maybe this is an indicator of some sort of spiritual connection held between people. I am not sure if anybody will ever know the reason why things like this happens.",3,3,2,3,4,-1.13
26479,"I think this happens because I was sensing their energy and knew what was happening. They wanted to make sure I could say ""goodbye"" to them and receive a message they wanted me to know. I have had experiences like this after a loved one has died but not right after. This would be a very interesting and strange experience to have but would definitely have some sort of deeper meaning.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
69853,"I am religious, so I would take this as a sign from God. It was the loved one coming to say goodbye before they left.",7,6,7,7,6,1.14
89905,"I guess this is some sort of magical connection we get among family members. Maybe the loved-one wanted to talk to me before he died, but I was not there. And this is how I receive his messages. It can be also due to the fact that I really missed him.",5,5,5,6,4,0.09
78894,"I would doubt that's because of magic, like, my grandma came to see me for one last time by some supernatural power. But then I will believe that this can be explained by some scientific theories we haven't explore yet.",4,4,4,5,4,-0.44
99961,"I personally believe that we are all interconnected and that when people need you the most is when you will show up for them. Just as I believe that people come into your life when you need them: I believe that when people are struggling you're given this sense that you need to connect with that person. I have personally experienced this and I don't entirely understand it. However, I do know that medically, people can show signs of improvement right before they die.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
22693,"I think that there is an ""other side"" of something higher than this current plane we live in exists, and sometimes people can hang onto this plane for a few moments to give their last goodbyes before moving on. I think that perhaps that far-away loved one knew that I could use an goodbye and just showed up to say they loved me without leaving me in the dark.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
77509,The universe is made up of energy and it is conserved so when they died their energy was transferred into my dream where they were able to communicate with me for a final time. sleep is also where i am not controlled by my conscious so spirits are able to easily enter my dream realm. loved ones often sometimes get a feeling someone is passing without having any actual awareness so maybe because I was sleep this would be another part of that feeling.,7,6,7,7,6,1.14
91997,I would believe that it was actually them coming to me in a dream to tell me the info they spoke to me about. This would be strange for me because I don't really think about people that I am around too much like that. I would think that it is God's way of letting them talk to me one more time.,7,6,7,7,6,1.14
24421,"I think that I dreamed about the far away loved one because they are an angel in my life. I do think that I believe in human angels, almost in a It's a Wonderful Life way, although I don't know why. This, I think, is why someone would have come to visit me before leaving- angels live with humans for good reasons and a final visit may have been to complete their given purpose. I suppose I know, from a scientific perspective, that a dream is just neurons firing and random brain activity, but I think that what I believe conflicts with this knowledge.",6,6,5,6,4,0.26
49285,"I'd assume it was coincidence. I probably dreamed about them because they were on my mind that day. I seek a lot of support from my loved ones, so it makes sense that I'd dream about an exchange like that. I also dream about them frequently as it is.",2,2,2,3,3,-1.48
71619,"I feel like this would be most likely to happen to me if I knew the their time was close. I think I would be more likely to be consciously or unconsciously thinking about this person and the emotion would be more likely to come up in my dreams. For example, I know that my grandparents are getting much older, so the love I feel for them is tinged with a bit of sadness when I think of them, because I know that I only have so much time left to spend with them. I think subtle feelings like this are likely to come up in dreams.",3,3,3,5,4,-0.78
92366,"I am going nuts because I don't understand how this kind of coincidence happened. It's likely just a coincidence. It's not like some exterior force or spirit made this happen, it's just life. Sometimes weird, connected things happen at the same time.",2,2,2,3,2,-1.83
71589,"I think this happens as a result of God's influence. I am religious, but aside from these beliefs I also think that some things happen for a reason. Maybe this is fate, maybe it is a serendipitous occurrence, but regardless I don't think this would happen without there being an intention or purpose. I think this happens in order for those who lose loved ones to find closure. I also think this may be God's way of providing comfort to people in situations like these, since there is nothing anyone living can really do to ""fix"" the issue.",7,7,7,7,5,1.14
77781,"It is situations like this that make me believe there probably is a higher power or doubt atheism. I think that the frequency of this occurring is not coincidental and probably occurs as a result of a higher power. I believe in souls, so I think perhaps this could be a visit from a person's soul before they go to an afterlife, if there is one, or just die for good. I definitely do not have a concrete answer for this one and there still is a great deal of confusion surrounding this for me.",6,7,7,7,6,1.31
62763,I believe this can happen out of pure coincidence sometimes. Our dreams can be very random from time to time so it makes sense that a random family member could suddenly visit us in a dream and give us some life advice. It is a crazy coincidence with a small chance of it happening but I think it can indeed happen and can be very offputting when it does. Sometimes dreams have a weird way of being very connected to our real lives as well but if there was truly no indication or background feeling that a distant family member may pass then it was just a coincidence.,3,3,2,3,4,-1.31
45094,I think this would happen if you subconsciously miss them and feel like their presence is lacking in your life. This could be the universe's way of allowing you to let go emotionally before you realize they are physically gone. One last fond memory and advice is something that you can use in the future and apply their wisdom to future obstacles so that it feels like they are walking with you.,5,6,5,5,4,0.09
16925,"I feel like our bodies or minds are connected more to our loved ones than we realize. For example, my great grandmother who I was close with died and I had dreams of her and especially after getting a bracelet of hers that I wear a lot. I call it my good luck bracelet. It could also be because you are just close to this person.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
93965,"In my family, it is not uncommon to have a dream about a a relative who just happens to live far away and then soon after learn the news that they have passed. To me, I have always seen it as a warning or heads up. A way to prepare for what is about to come. How this happens? No clue but it does reinforce this idea that we are all somehow connected.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
36842,"Various scenarios come to mind as to why this could have happened; one is pure coincidence, perhaps you were thinking about them during the day, and in your dreams your subconsciousness worked it in. There have also been instances of close individuals, such as twins, experiencing an almost psychological connection, like feeling pain in a body part the other twin hurt. There could be a connection of that type with the close person, though I would not know how or why it occurs.",5,4,5,5,4,-0.26
85953,"If my loved one was sick, I would understand why I would have a dream about them, especially one where they give me advice they would not be able to tell me in their current state. I think this happens because if someone we love and look up to is unwell, we start to think about all the things we want to say to them before they pass away, as well as what they might want to say to us.",5,4,5,6,4,-0.09
99276,"I think our minds sometimes create things we may need or want to hear, even sometimes things we might not want to hear! Perhaps the grandparent's spirit is visiting you in your sleep, but I am not sure on how I exactly feel about that.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
82483,I do not believe in outside forces but I think if it was close friend or relative I would pay attention closely. I think it may have happened because deep down we all are connected in some fashion. Things like thinking of people at the same time and calling them is some form of what happened with this dream.,5,6,5,5,4,0.09
79340,"I don't think there is a reason for this happening, beyond a coincidence. But, I would treasure the advice I received in the dream out of memory for the loved one. If the dream felt real, it would essentially be my last memory of that person. The dream sounds like a good memory, so it would be a good way to remember that loved one.",3,3,3,4,4,-0.96
58555,"The deceased family member was visiting me before going to heaven. They visited me because they regretted not telling me this wisdom when they were alive. They wanted their last memory of them to be memorable and to say their final goodbye in ""person."" It is a sign of how much they loved me.",6,5,6,6,4,0.26
26708,"Oh I might feel really bad if my far-away loved one passed away. But yes, I find this situation to be reasonable because although I don't know the underlying reason behind this, I feel like there's always some mutual connections between people. If you are happy with someone through one experience, the other person would probably feel the same. We are all social people, and we thrive through positive connections with others.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
31579,"This can happen when someone has a special bond with another person. These special bonds bring people closer together and allows them to be ""in sync"". Another reason this can happen is spirituality. Some people believe that spirits can inhabit your dreams.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
83629,"I would think that this happened because I likely had something in the previous days that reminded me of that individual (i.e. saw a photo, smelled a scent I associate with them, etc). I think this type of event happens because your brain wants to make subliminal connections and try to make events meaningful. I also think that this is a way for your brain to cope with extreme emotions.",3,3,3,5,4,-0.78
11221,"I believe that if this happened, my entire life view would change. My religious beliefs run thin if at all and my scientific side is very prominent but if something like this happened, I would feel very lucky to have my grandparent not only visit me, but impart some sort of knowledge before passing on. I also feel as though if it made sense to, I would pass the knowledge onto others and especially those that need to hear it assuming it makes sense with their situation.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
35670,"This has actually happened to me before, but they come visit me after they've passed. I'm a spiritual person, so I believe this happens because your loved one recognizes that you need their support in that moment. I think some part of the universe recognizes that this loved one is important to you, so they send them over to impart some last wisdom. Also, I think this is a way for relatives or the universe to tell you that you are not alone and that you are able to face the battles that come your way.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
50144,"If this happened to me, I would see it as something very meaningful because I usually don't remember my dreams enough to explain them to someone the next day or write them down. I might think that my loved one visited me in a dream to say goodbye to me and leave me with words of wisdom before they moved on to some sort of afterlife or ceased to exist. I would hold these words very close to my heart and believe that they were things I was supposed to hear.",6,5,6,6,4,0.26

Regardless of whether or not it was the result of coincidence or some deeper spiritual connection, knowing that the ones we love love us too is important and comforting.",2,2,2,3,4,-1.48
62768,"I would view this interaction as some kind of strong spiritual connection between myself and this person. I am religious, so I suppose that an explanation for this could be that they were communicating with me from an afterlife. However, if this scenario really happened, I don't know if this is the conclusion I would actually jump to. I would probably try to rationalize why this happened logically by saying that there was likely some other event that triggered this thought in my mind.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
41401,i like to imagined that this happened because this significant figure has played an important part of your role either growing up with you personally or helping you with your darkest times. or neither yet they made you feel happy in certain ways and you find comfort in their presence. the fact that they came over to your and exclaimed life wisdom meant that your impact on them is also significant. they had spent their last moments breathing just to talk with you and share their stories with you too. it's very heart-touching and that they will always have a special place in your heart.,5,6,5,5,4,0.09
85043,"Perhaps subconsciously you knew that they were close to their death and your mind tried to protect you and bring you comfort by imagining them in your dream. You conjure up an image of them in your mind as a way of coping with the fact that you know they might be gone, and imagine them giving you life wisdom. It might help you feel more closure towards their death in general.",3,3,3,5,4,-0.78
46483,I think this happened because they have passed away but want to leave you the last words before they go. I am a somewhat spiritual person and I believe in the life after-death.

81812,"My grandfather visited me in a dream and assured me that I am capable of anything. Then, he died of ongoing illness.

29198,"This is most likely a coincidence. This far-away loved one was likely sick and, in focusing on them, your subconscious mind has conjured happy memories and thoughts about them.

Since they have been in your thoughts recently and you are concerned, it is natural for your subconscious to try to work through your emotions by dreaming.",2,2,2,3,4,-1.48
41041,"I'm not the most spiritual person but I don't think there are any logical explanations for why this may happen. My guess would be that their essence was trying to comfort and communicate with me. Another guess would be an extremely rare coincidence. Unfortunately, I don't remember my dreams as often as I used to so I'm not even sure if I would remember it.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
84440,"I feel as though this would happen as a part of my loved one's departure.

I think that this is definitely a realistic scenario as I believe in the afterlife.",6,5,6,6,4,0.26
59678,"I do not feel like there is a correlation between the two just because there is no scientific evidence dreams translate to reality. However, I do feel like perhaps I was going through something personal I was struggling with and needed a figure to spearhead my growth.

16861,"I believe that this happens to give people a sense of closure that they may have otherwise not received. When people die, their spirits are able to communicate with people who they have felt connected to throughout their life. I feel like this can happen through dreams, gut feelings, and deja vu. Depending on the relationship you have with the other person, receiving their wisdom in a dream can be a reflection of your unconscious desire to please them or looking to them for approval.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
11003,I think this could happen because subconsciously you are thinking about them and wanting to connect with them. This might mean you have a sense of longing for them and you want to see them.,5,4,5,5,4,-0.26
20638,I this could happen if they were sick and I knew they may die soon. I think the wisdom may be something they said when I was younger and it was stored somewhere in my subconscious and might reappear when I am thinking about them more often.,3,4,3,3,4,-0.96

I think their soul would be able to go into another realm/dream plane in order to visit.,7,7,7,7,6,1.31
16742,I think there is a great power that connects us together in the world. It can be religious or non-religious but things seem to happen for a reason.

73467,"I am not a spiritual or religious person; however, sometimes things like this happen for unexplained reasons. Or perhaps, there is a science behind it and you knew this person was sick, old, or lived a high risk lifestyle and were worried about them which manifested through a dream. I believe that dreams are manifestations of your emotions or things you are thinking about or working through. Therefore, a person visiting you in your dream and then learning they died may have just been your way of working through whatever is going on in your life.

We are still great friends but just not as close as when in high school.

We had a great connection that will last a lifetime even when we are separated for forever.",6,5,6,6,5,0.44
27006,"I think that this would happen because of a divine intervention as a way to comfort me in my loved one's passing and also as a way for that loved one to be at peace knowing that I know what they wanted to tell me.

50119,"I'm fairly spiritual and also Buddhist so I would probably think that this was their spirit or soul visiting before leaving this world or dimension. My family has a history of having experiences communicating with deceased loved ones and maintaining relationships with deceased loved ones as well as having unexpected encounters with them. The human brain is essentially a sensor and perceives *only* what it is able to sense as the only reality, so there is a possibility that there's another dimension/world/whatever you want to call it that we are simply unable to sense, though some individuals are able to tune into it. I sound like a crazy person to most people.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96

I don't totally believe that who I was talking to in the dream was their spirit, I believe more in that the dream was created by my subconscious because I could sense something was off. When my mom died a couple years ago, it came suddenly, but I could start sensing that things were a bit ""off"" leading up to when she died. The dream probably came from that kind of feeling that their death is unavoidable.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09

Before they leave our plane of existence I think they want to make sure that everything will be okay once their gone, and by reminding us that their love still lives on even after they die, it gives us some comfort to keep going forward. My mom used to work in a hospice center and she said that sometimes people would be close to death for a long time until their loved ones had the time to come say goodbye, then they would die shortly after.

As far as loved-ones coming to you I am sincerely not sure - perhaps it is something outside of understanding into the spiritual realm of creation.

I think when we're deeply connected to people we are able to relate and maybe predict what is going to happen in their lives or we are so connected that we can also have the sense they are in trouble and then our brain tries to justify this.

While I do not particularly believe in the afterlife or something extra out there orchestrating things, if this were to happen, I would definitely question it more. On a much smaller scale, this morning (my phone was on silent too), I was waking up and my brain formed a picture in my head of a notification popping up on my screen with a text from a specific friend. I had no reason to believe this so I opened my eyes and 1 min ago there was a text from that friend. It felt so weird cuz I don't know how my brain came up with that, but I think it can be tied to a weird 6th sense. The brain is able to make connections that we would never be able to consciously, so I believe that we would be aware of the sudden change and the brain forms those images in your sleep to make you aware/soothe the upcoming pain.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09

However, I may have had such a dream because I was thinking a lot about this loved one recently, and perhaps things they told me in the past were freshly in my mind. I don't think there is any extra-physical/spiritual connection between people, and as far as I know the only motivator for dreams is your mental activity, both conscious and subconscious. Thus, the only way I think this could have happened is that I was thinking a lot about this loved one and they just happened to die during that particular night.",2,2,2,3,3,-1.48

In some ways, I think God sends those to comfort us, to show us that we have an angel looking out for us. Sometimes it might come in a form of a dream, other times its other signs in the world around us, like a certain animal, sound, scent or other cue that meant a lot to that person.

98971,"Well, that would be terrifying. Though I'm naturally a bit critical and analytical, I'm also religious and believe in God, so that would be my reason for this. The purely scientific explanation would be that you've had that person on your mind lately, even without realizing it, and your dream reflected that, while also happening to coincide with their death. Though that's not impossible, I think the nature of the dream and the timing is lined up too well, and I would credit that to God giving me an opportunity to say bye to them, or ""see"" them one last time.",6,5,6,6,4,0.26

82730,This would be so heartbreaking. I think this would happen because their spirit would come visit us in our sleep and remind us that they care for us and are still here for us even though they have passed.

The next morning someone called her to let her know, and she responded that she already knew and told them about her dream. I think this has to do with the spirituality my grandmother was raised with in Appalachia, as this is a common for people there to have visits like this. My mother and sister have had similar moments as well, but it hasn't happened to me yet.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
53359,I think our subconscious recognizes that the person is about to pass soon even if we may not want to consciously admit that to ourselves.

These shields (defensiveness, logic, exhaustion, work, other priorities) can impede that pure connection that naturally flows from our emotions. Humans have a life-force about them (I use religious terminology because that's what makes the most sense to me, but there's a lot of different ways to phrase it) that can be used to do miraculous things, like a dying soul saying farewell.",7,7,7,7,6,1.31

84674,I'm not entirely sure as to why this happened--there could be a multitude of explanations depending on the person. It may be coincidental or simply because that person had been on someone's mind.,2,2,2,3,4,-1.48
88691,"I can't think of a logical, or scientific explanation for this scenario. When you become exceptionally close with someone, it's almost like there's a sense of togetherness and a feeling of being in sync even when you are far apart. I'm kind of at a loss for words for answering this question.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
60956,"I think there is some connection between what you dream and what happens in reality; It could definitely be some kind of regret that something isn't fulfilled in reality that got into your dreams. It would be a really sad situation but at the same time something would be fulfilled and are meant to be. For example, you at least got to ""say"" goodbye and listen to your loved-one.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
79470,There would have to be a higher-power acting because that is too much of a coincidence.I think that God would have done this to me to give me peace over their passing. I would also believe that it was actually them or their spirit in the dream. Sometimes God will try to help us with grief and overcoming those dark places.,7,6,7,7,6,1.14
35567,"I think that this may have happened because it is possible that this loved one had been sick for a while. You may have been subconsciously thinking about the loved ones health for a while. It could even be that they were in extremely bad conditions the day before. At times, dreaming consists of thoughts that we have suppressed or that are lingering on our mind. If not, and the individual was perfectly healthy, this may just be a miracle beyond my understanding.",3,3,3,4,4,-0.96
89992,"I think this happens as a result of some unconscious desire to spend more time with a loved one you managed to know passed away. Maybe there is some spiritual factor that is involved. For example, perhaps your loved one's spirit was able to get in touch with everyone they loved that lived nearby, and you were the only one left. The spirit managed to visit you and help you one last time.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
68324,"I think this happens because we are all connected in some way. Once you meet someone, it is really easy to stay connected to them for a very very long time. If they made a major impact on your life, it's not surprising that this happens. I think this can happen because of some unknown metaphysical thing that is between all humans that hasn't been discovered yet.",5,6,5,6,4,0.26
68324,"I think this happens because we are all somehow indirectly connected with one another through an unknown connection that isn't exactly obvious at first glance. In some metaphysical way, you are connected to your loved one which allows them to contact you once last time through your self conscious. I don't think the exact means for why this happens has been discovered yet. I believe that once it is discovered, it will be much clearer exactly how this happens.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
48552,"This has to be some sort of external force, like God giving a sign and giving a farewell chance for your loved one. There has to be some sort of outside force that connects that, especially if you never have that dream before. There could be some sort of outside force that helps you feel their death in your sleep. It is a fairly common thing for mothers to have similar experiences I have heard.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
87790,"I think dreams are connected to how we feel, but also help us engage in the future of who we want to be. They are an outlet to solve our problems and offer us a hypothetical situation into how we could work through the difficult parts of our lives. If I had a dream that my far-away loved one unexpectedly visits me to impart life wisdom and say they love me, I believe it happens because as people depart in life, they send signs. I am a firm believer in signs through prayer, dreams, and physical objects. Even though I did not know about the death, there was a physical and spiritual connection that brought us together through love.",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
29440,I think this happens because you subconsciously know that something bad is going to happen. I think our brains know that something unfortunate is going to happen before we are aware of it. This would explain impending feelings of doom. Our brain may be trying to prepare us for bad news.,5,4,5,5,4,-0.26
11158,"Honestly, I'm not sure how these things happen. I believe God definitely has something to do with it, but there is still so much mystery involved with situations like these. I believe instances like these are a way of God guiding us along our journey. It definitely isn't easy though.",7,6,7,7,6,1.14
53023,"I think that this happens because it is God's way of allowing them to say goodbye to me. It also is to give me some closure of knowing I got to ""see"" them one last time. I believe that there is life after death so this would be a way to get life wisdom from someone I care about until I am able to see them again. God sends us messages in mysterious ways sometimes, and in this case the message came through a dream.",7,7,7,7,6,1.31
81089,"I think that this would happen because of a higher-power being or spirit that is related to the afterlife. If this were to happen, I would be more convinced of a life beyond our own. I would know that I had a great connection with this loved one that they felt the need to visit before they died. I think that their spirit would know that they needed to give me and them some peace before they went to the afterlife.",7,7,7,7,7,1.49
53480,I think that sometimes dreams are able to almost predict the future. In this dream it would be almost like them coming to say goodbye because they are not able to do it in person. I think that this would be saddening to actually happen but it would also feel very meaningful to know that they loved you and everything they said to you.,5,6,5,5,4,0.09
78649,It could be possible I had a strong intuitive sense about an event as drastic as someone who is close to me passing away. I am not sure what could be said about such an event other than it seems like there must be an energy that is bound to the two of us or the act of dying. It could also be a coincidence or a transcendental experience. I don't necessarily believe it's them communicating after death but maybe it's something like that paired with an intuitive feeling.,5,6,5,5,4,0.09
28435,"This happens probably because of some gut feeling that you have that they have parted. because of the distance, your subconscious automatically regrets not being able to speak to them for the last time, and it wants you to feel as though you did. especially with someone whom you truly love and would miss terribly, you would want to have a last conversation that would help you feel connected with them and have some wisdom that could later on connect you.",5,4,5,5,4,-0.26
58705,"I think I would have the dream because I felt something unconsciously wrong. I don't really have an explanation for why the two things would be correlated or how I could possibly know about their passing before the dream, but I think it would just be one of those things that just happen. There isn't a scientific explanation, just the bond between two people that can't be explained.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
44821,"I would believe in some sort of other plan of existence. I would be exhilarated and devastated. It would feel good in the sense that I would have proof in life after death, at least in some way, and I could believe that there was something bigger than myself, but devastated at the loss.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
46757,I believe that my loved one died and visited me in my dream. I believe that there is some kind of afterlife that allows this to happen.,6,5,6,6,4,0.26
82369,I think that this might have happened from some higher power/entity trying to give you one last good memory from your loved one. It could have also just been you thinking about this person so you had a dream about them. Seeing them in your dream could also just be a form of reminders for important life advice to follow. The advice coming in this form might be because you have been avoiding something important in your life.,6,6,7,7,5,0.96
31926,"I have two different ways of answering this question. From a religious side, I would consider that a blessing from God, and feel very grateful for being allowed to see my loved one's spirit one last time. On the other hand, a more rational approach would suggest that you simply think about that person subconsciously from time to time, and a desire to see them again brought them into your dreams.",6,5,6,6,4,0.26
40309,"I think this happens because you have a connection to them and might be able to sense that something is wrong subconsciously. I also think it gives you closure in a way such that they are able to tell you what they need to before they pass. Even though you don't get a proper goodbye, in a way you are able to talk them. Regardless of it is in a dream, I think this happens so that you can know they love you and care for you.",5,6,5,5,4,0.09
84070,"I think the connection we have with people especially those who are close and share the same blood has an effect on people. I think humans can sense departure of this world or the other loves you so much they come to ""visit.""",6,6,7,7,5,0.96
61818,"I would interpret this as, first, the person loves me as much as I love her. Second, I think that is a sign of us caring about each other. The action of the unexpected visit and saying they love me might hint that we did not express our love to each other that much before.",5,5,5,5,4,-0.09
