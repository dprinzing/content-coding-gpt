I would feel devastated and would be planning an apology (if the mistake was completely mine) or a time to clarify any miscommunications. I do not like it when people are mad at me, and I often try to resolve any issues as soon as possible. I am good at confronting problems and discussing with others/ having conversations about relationships.",0.80,"

I hurt their feelings by not being empathetic and compassionate enough to them when they were talking about an issue I saw as solvable. I think they are right to be upset with me, but wrong not to see it from my point of view. I am offering them a genuine solution to the issue they are having.",0.40,"

82023,angry,They are angry because I told them how they hurt me. I keep telling them not to do such things that make me upset but they keep doing it. The fact that I have to repeat expressing how much they hurt me makes them angry with me. I feel like it was totally my fault and I should have sucked it up and never should have expressed how hurt I was.,-0.50,"

24208,angry,"They're angry with me partially because they've been through a lot and a lot of people hurting them, and also probably just to control me, to make me feel guilty. I think what led to this is me being late somewhere, or changing my plans I had with them over something important. It might've been my family that impacted it. I feel like the victim, I feel unjustly insulted but I also feel a bit guilty wondering what I can do to make them calm down.",-0.50,"

I may have forgotten to do what I should do, which negatively influenced the whole group and forced others to work hard to make up for my mistakes. I would feel extremely ashamed of bringing huge trouble to my group and feel like a trouble myself.",0.80,"

50050,angry,"They are angry with me because I fail to achieve their expectations or crossed some barriers in human interactions that I was mostly oblivious of. Depending on the person and situations, I will feel terrible about letting others down and angry at myself, or just completely ignore it and goes on to deal with my own matters. Selective ignorance is one thing I learned to do when I want to be more effective in completing some projects.",0.60,"

He would be frustrated that I am not as interested in what he finds engaging. I would be annoyed because I do not care about video games and would rather spend time doing something else with him. I would also feel guilty that I did not want to watch his games, since I know that they are important to him.",0.60,"

89912,angry,"If someone is angry with me forreal, it's probably because I said something mean. Not necessarily because I planned to do so, or am someone with malice at heart, but because I am loose with my words or thoughts sometimes. If I genuinely make someone angry, I typically feel really bad because often I didn't intend to do that.",0.60,"

85445,angry,"There can be many reasons they are angry with me. It could be that I disappointed, hurt, betrayed, or lied to the person. Or it could also be that our ideas conflict with each other, so we cannot reach consensus. It could also be that the person is having a bad day and he/she is throwing a tantrum to me.

If I did what I intended I would feel comfortable with my actions knowing that I made a conscious decision and did what I believed I should even if it didn't line up with what they wanted.

This is why I would try to find the reason, to figure out the source. Usually, when someone is angry at me, it is because of something I did that made them upset. I would try to ask them why this made them feel upset, and try to resolve the issue with minimal conflict.",0.80,"

My parents will be mad about me getting a bad grade on an exam if they know the week leading up to it I barely studied and spent a lot of time on ""useless"" activities like hanging out with friends. And my boyfriend will be nearly mad at me when I forget we have plans to hang out and I then try to make it work with both parties and he ultimately doesn't get to spend as much time with me as he wanted.

Sometimes I act out of my own wants/needs and don't tell the person, which in turn can make the person feel unheard and disregarded. I don't like to have people feel mad at me, because it feels shitty knowing that it could have been avoided if we just communicated.

I make a pretty active effort to avoid doing things that make other people angry, but for argument's sake my lack of reliability (ie constantly being late to things) is one of my more irritating traits.

There have been times where I ostracize people in my life after arguments, most likely political, and they tend to get angry due to my reaction, which would most likely be anger or passion that could come out as anger.
