82023,angry,They are angry because I told them how they hurt me. I keep telling them not to do such things that make me upset but they keep doing it. The fact that I have to repeat expressing how much they hurt me makes them angry with me. I feel like it was totally my fault and I should have sucked it up and never should have expressed how hurt I was.,2.00,"The participant's response shows some aspects of humility, but not all. They seem to have a calm self-concept (A) and are aware of their own feelings and weaknesses.

However, the response does not clearly demonstrate a balanced perception of themselves (B), as they seem to take all the blame for the situation.

24208,angry,"They're angry with me partially because they've been through a lot and a lot of people hurting them, and also probably just to control me, to make me feel guilty. I think what led to this is me being late somewhere, or changing my plans I had with them over something important. It might've been my family that impacted it. I feel like the victim, I feel unjustly insulted but I also feel a bit guilty wondering what I can do to make them calm down.",2.00,"Based on the participant's response, I would assess their humility as follows:

A. The participant does express some guilt and acknowledges their potential role in the situation, but they also seem to focus on feeling like a victim. This shows some awareness of their weaknesses, but also a tendency to feel distressed. 

B. The participant is able to consider their own actions as a possible cause for the other person's anger, but they also attribute the anger to external factors, such as the other person's past experiences and desire for control. This shows a mix of accepting responsibility and deflecting blame.

C. The participant does not explicitly mention being open to learning from the situation or receiving feedback, but their expression of guilt and wondering what they can do to make the other person calm down suggests some openness to growth.

D. The participant shows some awareness of the other person's feelings and needs, but they also focus on their own feelings of being a victim and unjustly insulted. This indicates a limited awareness of and appreciation for others.

E. The participant does not directly address egalitarian beliefs in their response, so it is difficult to assess this characteristic based on the provided text.

Taking all of these factors into consideration, I would give the participant a composite score of 2, indicating that they display some aspects of humility, but also have areas where they could improve. Score: 2.",21962
