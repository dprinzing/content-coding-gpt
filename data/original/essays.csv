89662,"I am religious (Christian). I would think that this had happened because God had willed this to occur. I would also maybe think that the close relative or friend may have prayed about this, and that they had wanted to tell me something. I would not think that it was a complete coincidence, especially is it was so sudden.","I don't imagine that this is likely, but only because this has never happened before to em. Perhaps I would imagine that this has happened because it was ""meant to be."" I would believe that this person is someone who I will have a valuable relationship with, whether that be as a mentor-mentee, friends, or romantic relationship. I would say that this sentiment/ thought comes from my spirituality/ religion as well.  ","I would imagine that this person is angry with me because of a miscommunication or something that I had said out of frustration or anger during a conversation. I would feel devastated and would be planning an apology (if the mistake was completely mine) or a time to clarify any miscommunications. I do not like it when people are mad at me, and I often try to resolve any issues as soon as possible. I am good at confronting problems and discussing with others/ having conversations about relationships. ","I would imagine that I had received the award for something in science/ research. I would have achieved the award through probably years of work, mentorship and help from my lab members or coworkers. I would feel elated, proud, but humbled. I would feel that I deserved it, but only because I had received help from others and because I was blessed with the gift of education/ knowledge. I would also continue in my efforts in science and/or research, to continue advancing knowledge in my field. "
65329,I think they visited me upon their crossing over to the other side. Their soul probably visited each family member/person they cared for in a personal way to provide comfort upon their death. I would accept that dream as closure and assurance that my family member is okay on the other side. It would help me to move on after their death.,"I think that in a way, we are all connected on a deep level. I don't put a lot of thought into encounters like this though. The furthest I've thought into it is that everyone in our life enters and exits for a reason. I don't yet think that feeling this feeling necessarily has any meaning.","They are angry with me because I hurt their feelings. I hurt their feelings by not being empathetic and compassionate enough to them when they were talking about an issue I saw as solvable. I think they are right to be upset with me, but wrong not to see it from my point of view. I am offering them a genuine solution to the issue they are having. ","I won an award for revolutionizing medicine through increased awareness of self. Through my research, I was able to create a new path for self healing both on a physical and spiritual level. This increased self awareness allows for the collective to open our minds and connect with the world around us. I feel proud of myself for receiving this award and hope that others respect my efforts for getting to where I am."
82023,"Because I did not have a chance to say goodbye, my loved one come back and say goodbye to me. Besides, maybe our relationship in real life is not good enough for both of us to say we love each other and for life wisdom. By telling me indirectly in my dream, it might have been easier. Maybe it is less sad to say goodbye in dream than in real life. ","I think that we probably have the same backgrounds, personalities, and goals. I used to think it could be soulmates, but my logical side tells me that it is just the same network circle that we share that brings us together and makes us feel connected. I think this happens naturally as our network circles overlap with one another. My romantic side will probably think it's fate though. ",They are angry because I told them how they hurt me. I keep telling them not to do such things that make me upset but they keep doing it. The fact that I have to repeat expressing how much they hurt me makes them angry with me. I feel like it was totally my fault and I should have sucked it up and never should have expressed how hurt I was. ,I received the award for being the most caring person in my community. I cared about other people's well-beings and did everything I could for them to make them feel loved and happy. I feel happy that I was able to help others. I feel like what I was doing was right. 
24208,"I think that how this would happen is they would think of someone when they're right about to die. Maybe they have a choice with which person they want to talk to, and generally I think most people pick the youngest person they can still impart wisdom onto. It's happened to me before. I think that on a bigger scale, I guess cosmically, it happens to show you that you're not alone and that they will be okay despite passing away. That you were in their thoughts and they wanted to say their last goodbye to you before they left. ","I think this happened while we were outside on some field (or that's how I picture it). We probably met through some event, maybe done by the university, and we just started being social- my friends and their friends- until the conversation showed us how similar we are. That's what makes it feel like I know them, plus their face looks so familiar. I think we might've met as kids, and I think it could've happened to show me I'm on the right track or to bring us together if one us has been having a rough time. I feel like the world might bring people together like this to help them both through tough times. ","They're angry with me partially because they've been through a lot and a lot of people hurting them, and also probably just to control me, to make me feel guilty. I think what led to this is me being late somewhere, or changing my plans I had with them over something important. It might've been my family that impacted it. I feel like the victim, I feel unjustly insulted but I also feel a bit guilty wondering what I can do to make them calm down. ","I just received the award for a discovery that I made that impacted the Neuroscience/Psychology field. It's like a Nobel prize or something. I think I was able to achieve it through clinical research over years and working with like a group of people as the head of them before we finally made some breakthrough discovery. I feel happy about getting it but I'm crying a little in it, basically just feeling like my purpose has been fulfilled and all the work I've done is getting recognition. I feel like I can safely say I've impacted people now. "
90614,I would feel unable to accept the truth. I know they love me but I haven't got a chance to say I love you too to them. The reason I had that dream may be that they really missed me and hoped to see me in the last minute. ,"The scenario that came to my mind is that we would meet each other during a trip or in a workshop. We would surprisingly find that we have similar experience in childhood, similar values and dreams to chase, and similar difficulties or troubles we are trying to overcome.  ","In my imagination, they might be angry because I messed up some important tasks. I may have forgotten to do what I should do, which negatively influenced the whole group and forced others to work hard to make up for my mistakes. I would feel extremely ashamed of bringing huge trouble to my group and feel like a trouble myself.","I received the award for being kind and helpful to people around me. I think it's one of the natural traits inside me to help people and offer emotional support for them. I always feel empowered when empowering others. I would feel really happy about getting it, which in some way demonstrates my strengths and my values of existence. "
50050,I would not think about it much. Past is dead and life goes on. I tend to focus on my current goals than what have been happened in the past. It is the best way to clear my mind from disturbing thoughts that will not be beneficial or efficient in any way possible.,It is possible that we have shared several common hobbies and are able to engage in deep discussion in such areas. Usually people of similar background will experience this more often. The ability to listen to one another and make witty comments is a good way to give others a good impression. Mutual kindness and humor can also create a sense of closeness. ,"They are angry with me because I fail to achieve their expectations or crossed some barriers in human interactions that I was mostly oblivious of. Depending on the person and situations, I will feel terrible about letting others down and angry at myself, or just completely ignore it and goes on to deal with my own matters. Selective ignorance is one thing I learned to do when I want to be more effective in completing some projects.","I would image myself to receive an award in academics from I the time I have invested in studying. I would be feeling that all my hard work for in-class and extra-curricular activities have finally pay off. I would be both relaxed and nervous when getting it, since it gives me a sense of worth creates the overconfidence that will get to me later."
45583,"I think that this happens because they (and God) knew that you needed to hear from them one last time. They are able to pass this message on to you through a dream because this is the best and least upsetting way of reaching you. 

However, I think it is possible to have these sorts of dreams without the loved one dying. When this occurs, you are less likely to remember/place importance on the dream and advice because it was not made significant by their death. This occurs because you were thinking of them or worrying about them, not necessarily because you are receiving a message from them.","This often occurs because you have much in common or similar life experiences. Your personalities also often complement each other. When you talk, it seems like you have so many shared experiences and beliefs. Even if you didn't experience those events together, it seems like you did because you view and relate them in the same way. ","I am imagining that my brother is angry at me. He is most likely angry because I did not watch him play his video games. He would be frustrated that I am not as interested in what he finds engaging. I would be annoyed because I do not care about video games and would rather spend time doing something else with him. I would also feel guilty that I did not want to watch his games, since I know that they are important to him.  ","Most of the awards I have ever received have been for school, so I would like to have received an award for theatre. I would feel proud of myself and happy. It would be for being accomplished at musical theatre. In order to receive it, I would have had to get over my fear of singing on stage and merge my singing and acting skills. "
89912,"Well I'm not sure if I can answer how/why that would happen exactly, but I can give my best guess. I would assume that their arrival in the dream was a sign. I'm not super religious or one to believe in a lot of supernatural phenomena, but I do think everything happens for a reason. Them coming in that dream was probably their way of saying goodbye to you and getting closure. ","It could happen because we like a lot of the same things. It could happen because we have similar temperaments, or that the temperaments that we do have compliment each other really well. Sometimes, when you meet someone new and really give them a chance, you can really be surprised by how alike you are.","If someone is angry with me forreal, it's probably because I said something mean. Not necessarily because I planned to do so, or am someone with malice at heart, but because I am loose with my words or thoughts sometimes. If I genuinely make someone angry, I typically feel really bad because often I didn't intend to do that. ","I just won the boyfriend of the year award! I got it because though I am flawed, I am a well-meaning and thoughtful person. I always try to go above and beyond to make sure my girlfriend is happy and feeling good. I feel great about getting it, because it validates my hard work."
85445,"I don't know how and why this happens at all. My guess would be that as I miss my loved one, she also misses me and cares about me, and so before she dies, she actually sends me a message through my dream.","It could be that the person knows a lot about me and I happen to know a lot about him. Moreover, we like each other instantly so it feels like old friends. The reason or this could be that I've met and known people sharing similar personalities as that someone before.","There can be many reasons they are angry with me. It could be that I disappointed, hurt, betrayed, or lied to the person. Or it could also be that our ideas conflict with each other, so we cannot reach consensus. It could also be that the person is having a bad day and he/she is throwing a tantrum to me. No matter what the reason is, I would feel very upset and I would be filled with negative emotions all over my body.","The award may be something regarding my achievement in academics. I was able to receive it because I studied hard and successfully applied all the learning techniques, skills, and time management skills in my life. I would feel very proud of myself."
87242,"I'm not one to necessarily believe in higher powers or destiny that may cause this kind of thing, but I do thing people have a pretty strong sense of intuition which may be at play. In a situation like this, I would argue 'you' personally had some sort of subconscious understanding that your loved one might pass and so you materialized this advice yourself as a means of getting closure. There have been times in my life, even recently, similar to this where I was in disbelief that the timing could have been so perfect. But to that end, I still think even in times of weakness or bad health we inherently have some sort of intuition or willpower that allows us to for example hold on until a loved one can see us before we pass.","I think that type of natural connection comes from a generally similar view of the world. This can be by way of the way we were raised, particularly important moments in our childhood, or compatible personalities in general. Regardless of why our views of the world are similar, I think that people's worldview really dictates their personality, sense of humor, and general way of connecting to people. There are other factors like an openness to communicate which may contribute to it, but I would say there has to be some kind of shared experience or worldview to get this sense of familiarity.","I'd imagine I did something that they didn't expect or want. My feeling about the situation would depend on how I approached it or acted. If I did what I intended I would feel comfortable with my actions knowing that I made a conscious decision and did what I believed I should even if it didn't line up with what they wanted. If it was an unintended action or had consequences I didn't expect, I would definitely feel a level of shame and try to apologize or make it up to them in some way.","I can't imagine what I would receive an award for, but it would have to be something to do with communication or involvement. I don't like striving for actual awards or nominations and feel the best role I play in communities is connecting people within them behind the scenes. I'd feel somewhat proud but also a little out of place actually receiving an award, as the pride comes with the work itself not some sort of title. Getting the award itself would definitely not be something I would have pursued myself."
76170,"When someone older gives me advice, I try to listen to them and see how I could implement their advice into my life. Often times, my grandmother tells me things that are for my own good, even if I do not think so at that moment. I will say that even though they give me advice, this does not mean I am going to follow it, but I respect their thought, and will consider it. It is also a foreshadowing moment to know that one of their last memories you have of them is about wisdom, and is something you will probably never forget. ","I believe that sharing the same values as someone really helps you connect with that person. For example, if you both believe in faith, then you are more likely to feel connected with them, rather then someone who does not. I feel like also having the same personality as someone, being happy/positive, can help you connect with them on a deeper level, even if you haven't known them for that long.  Having a general sense of openness with the other person, such as smiling, being positive, can also help. ","If someone is angry at me, I would try to figure out the reason for this. Most of the time, the anger they feel can be misjudged, in a sense that they are disappointed or hurt. This is why I would try to find the reason, to figure out the source. Usually, when someone is angry at me, it is because of something I did that made them upset. I would try to ask them why this made them feel upset, and try to resolve the issue with minimal conflict. ","If I receive an award, it is usually for my dedication/hard work. I work very hard to accomplish tasks in life, whether it be school or other activities, and I know that I am sometimes rewarded for this. I wouldn't say that I would accomplish the work just for the reward, but more so to feel an accomplishment within myself. I feel that receiving the award can be good at times, however it is more in the pride in yourself that you feel for accomplishing the task. For example, when my parents tell me that they are proud of me for my hard work in school, I feel very accomplished and proud of myself, which does not happen if I were to get money for my grades. "
36009,"I think it's a sign form God. God wanted us to feel extra warm towards that person right before we learn of their death to make us feel more connected to them, so we keep them in our thoughts and prayers more, or maybe to make us feel remorseful for not spending more time with them while they were alive. But also to maybe energize us to follow their wisdom since it was the ""last thing"" they said to us before they died. ",I think that feeling might occur with both parties when our childhoods and current struggles are similar. And when we radiate the same vibe whethere= it's mutually relaxed or mutually excited. I think also having that comfort with someone where you can bounce back between talking about mundane things like your day and childhood trauma all in the same day bring about that feeling.,"Okay it's really hard for me to imagine this. My parents will be mad about me getting a bad grade on an exam if they know the week leading up to it I barely studied and spent a lot of time on ""useless"" activities like hanging out with friends. And my boyfriend will be nearly mad at me when I forget we have plans to hang out and I then try to make it work with both parties and he ultimately doesn't get to spend as much time with me as he wanted. I feel bad. I feel guilty about the bad grade because I upset my parents and know they were right and I could've done better. And I feel bad about my boyfriend because I forgot something and hurt his feelings.","I received an award for getting so far considering how much of a mess I am. Like I am loved and happy and able to put myself together even though I'm very disorganized, do everything last minute, and am so forgetful and literally move slowly. I feel happy about this award, like I really deserve it. I was able to achieve it by being myself and didn't have to fake anything."
88031,"To me, this would be a weird freak coincidence; I don't believe in religion or a higher power, so I wouldn't attribute it to anything like that. However, there have been multiple times where I have thought about somebody and then seen them shortly after. Maybe this is an indicator of some sort of spiritual connection held between people. I am not sure if anybody will ever know the reason why things like this happens. ","There have been a number of people that I've met with whom I've shared this mutual sense. I used to believe that some people were just meant to be in your life, but now I am not so sure about that. Possibly a more realistic take is that people are not as different as they think they are, and the odds of finding others who complement you that well or who click very easily are actually higher than expected.","Last night I ate some of my roommates blueberries and I feel guilty about it, so when I imagine someone being angry with me I picture her being upset that some of them are gone. Personally, I would be slightly upset that somebody ate my blueberries, so I would think that she is at least slightly bugged about it. I feel like I should maybe buy some berries and offer her some to compensate for the ones I ate, or share some other food item with her later.","I would love to make Dean's List again, so I'll imagine that I made it this semester, although I am not sure if that is technically an award. To make Dean's List, I would have worked hard through most of the semester with the support of my friends who motivate me to keep going. I would have done a good job with planning out my weeks and with staying on top of my school work and studying. If this was to happen, I would feel proud of myself, as I went through a rough academic period over the past two years."
26479,"I think this happens because I was sensing their energy and knew what was happening. They wanted to make sure I could say ""goodbye"" to them and receive a message they wanted me to know. I have had experiences like this after a loved one has died but not right after. This would be a very interesting and strange experience to have but would definitely have some sort of deeper meaning.",I think this happened because we are both friendly people and felt an instant feeling of connection. Sometimes when I have lots of things in common with someone it feels like I have known them for so long even though I had just met them. I don't really experience this much but when I do it is really cool. Having mutual friends can also contribute to feelings of knowing each other longer than reality.,"They are angry with me because I had to cancel our plans. They were super excited to see me and spend time together, but I wasn't really feeling up for having social interaction with someone. I feel bad about having to cancel but know that would be best for me. I would promise to see them soon.",I just received an award for doing well on the National Latin Exam. I was able to achieve this by taking Latin for multiple years and studying hard for the test. I feel very proud of myself for my accomplishments! My teacher was also very proud of me and wanted me to do well.
69853,"I am religious, so I would take this as a sign from God. It was the loved one coming to say goodbye before they left. ","I believe that some people are just meant to be together. Whether it's being best friends or in a relationship, everything happens for a reason and you were meant to be together. You were put in the same place at the same time for a reason. ","I think they are probably angry with me because I was being a bad communicator. I often find myself getting busy and caught up in my own life and forget to check up on others. This makes me feel extremely stressed and sad because I am a people pleaser and don't like when people are upset with me, especially those who I am close with. ",Usually when I receive an award it is for academic or athletic success. I receive the award for my hard work and dedication to a task. I devote lots of time to the task and work especially hard to stick out among other classmates/teammates. I am super proud of myself and encouraged to keep working when I get an award. 
89905,"I guess this is some sort of magical connection we get among family members. Maybe the loved-one wanted to talk to me before he died, but I was not there. And this is how I receive his messages. It can be also due to the fact that I really missed him.",I have heard about stories of reborn and new life after people are dead. Maybe we have met each other before in the previous life. Scientifically I think there may be some similarities between this guy and some one you know before. It can be physical traits or ways of talking.,"Maybe because we had some clashes when playing basketball. I was acting too hard and had strong physical contact with someone. I felt sorry for him right now, but I will probably just feel angry too at that scenario. ",maybe for being a good badminton player. I got it because I practiced a lot. I feel proud and happy.
78894,"I would doubt that's because of magic, like, my grandma came to see me for one last time by some supernatural power. But then I will believe that this can be explained by some scientific theories we haven't explore yet. ","I would say that's because we have the same atmosphere and other traits like moral value/habits/ways to deal with things, so we feel like we can talk easily with each other just like we know the other for years. Also, it is possible that she/he reminds me of someone I'm familiar with.","Maybe because I did something wrong; or, maybe they are poor at controlling their thoughts and behavior so they are easily getting irritated. Also, it is possible that there's misunderstanding between us. I feel very upset and stressful when others are angry at me, because somethings they yell at me, or do not respond to me when I talk with them.This can make me feel bad.  ","I just received an writing award in the summer break, since I wrote a short fiction about the ordinary women's life in my home country and over 15 thousands people shared this story. I practice a lot in writing, and read as much as I can. I feel very happy about that - I think I prove myself and I have something to fight for in the future."
99961,"I personally believe that we are all interconnected and that when people need you the most is when you will show up for them. Just as I believe that people come into your life when you need them: I believe that when people are struggling you're given this sense that you need to connect with that person. I have personally experienced this and I don't entirely understand it. However, I do know that medically, people can show signs of improvement right before they die. ","People are far more alike than they are different. It is all about being vulnerable enough to get outside of your comfort zone and engage with others. As long as you attempt to get to know the other person, you will find that while everyone lives their own life, it can be very similar, just from different perspectives. ","They are angry because I failed to spend enough time with them or make time with them. They feel less of a priority. I feel disappointed in myself for not making the time. However, I do know that I can't be everywhere for everyone as I have to take time for myself. ","I received an award for dedication and commitment to the service of others. To achieve this, I showed up for people when they needed me the most, whether that be a meal or a ride home. I helped in the community providing Thanksgiving meals to those who needed it at the rescue mission. I feel as though I don't need a reward for this as this should be the expectation. "
22693,"I think that there is an ""other side"" of something higher than this current plane we live in exists, and sometimes people can hang onto this plane for a few moments to give their last goodbyes before moving on. I think that perhaps that far-away loved one knew that I could use an goodbye and just showed up to say they loved me without leaving me in the dark. ","I would like to believe that in this world there is a sense of magic and living multiple lives is a possibility. It's kind of like having this deja vu feeling that already happens and it could exist in another dimension. There is also the realistic part of relationships, where you share so much in common and connect on a deep level that it feels as if you already knew each other. Something about being able to understand and connect with someone the first time you meet causes for a instant bond that feels ""just right"".  ","I wasn't considerate about their feelings or I went ahead and did something that I liked without regarding them/ listening to them. Sometimes I act out of my own wants/needs and don't tell the person, which in turn can make the person feel unheard and disregarded. I don't like to have people feel mad at me, because it feels shitty knowing that it could have been avoided if we just communicated. I would prefer to handle situations after I've cleared my head and can give neutral responses/ solutions without being clouded by emotions.  ","I would receive an award for hard work and dedication to something I've been doing. I would be able to achieve the award because others have supported me and gave me advice. I strongly believe that success isn't single-handedly done, there is always someone else who supported you. I think I would simply feel content and proud. "
77509,The universe is made up of energy and it is conserved so when they died their energy was transferred into my dream where they were able to communicate with me for a final time.  sleep is also where i am not controlled by my conscious so spirits are able to easily enter my dream realm.  loved ones often sometimes get a feeling someone is passing without having any actual awareness so maybe because I was sleep this would be another part of that feeling.,There would be a warmth or mutual calm about the interaction.  Conversation would flow easily with little pauses.  even shared silence would be comfortable rather than awkward.  there would also be the ability to share things about yourself with them easily without fear of embarrassment or judgement.,They are angry because they feel I do not make enough time for them in my life.  They feel that they are putting effort into our relationship but i am not reciprocating at the same level.  I feel that i can understand their feelings but at the same time have a lot on my plate and do not think they are understanding of my responsibilities and workload.  i am detached from the situation because i understand their feelings are not truly aimed at me.,i received the award for my discoveries in the neuroscience field in the realm of women mental health.  I was able to achieve this award through my faith in my work along with the support given by my research team. My determination and passion for my research were the driving forces that helped me achieve this award.  Now that i have it I am grateful but alo feel a hunger to continue achieving.
91997,I would believe that it was actually them coming to me in a dream to tell me the info they spoke to me about. This would be strange for me because I don't really think about people that I am around too much like that. I would think that it is God's way of letting them talk to me one more time. ,"I would just think that I met someone who is similar to someone I know or myself. I would think this because I have met a lot of people throughout my life. Therefore, feeling like I have already known someone must mean that there had been someone in my life I had met previously that were similar to them. They could also look like someone I had previously met.",They would be angry at me because I disagreed with them on something and I spoke out about it. They would be angry because they disagree with me. I personally would be upset with the person for being angry at me. I would be upset because I do not like confrontation and petty drama.,"I would get the award for leadership. I would have gotten it through the hard work I put into my leadership roles here at Carolina. Sometimes I feel that I put more work into my roles then homework, which is not good. I would feel acknowledged and happy about the award. "
24421,"I think that I dreamed about the far away loved one because they are an angel in my life. I do think that I believe in human angels, almost in a It's a Wonderful Life way, although I don't know why. This, I think, is why someone would have come to visit me before leaving- angels live with humans for good reasons and a final visit may have been to complete their given purpose. I suppose I know, from a scientific perspective, that a dream is just neurons firing and random brain activity, but I think that what I believe conflicts with this knowledge.","I think this happens because humans have so many shared experiences, whether we know it or not. Meeting someone who I feel I have known for decades (despite not being alive for decades) has happened before, and I think this is because of similar ways of growing up and lived experience, but mostly, similar ways of thinking. With some people, you can fall into such an easy conversation rhythm, if you've known them forever or only are meeting them at the dining hall, but with other people, you have to build that rhythm and work to establish that ""decades-long"" relationship.","They are angry with me because I forgot to do something I said I would. I made a promise to do something, and, whether I meant to or not, I broke it. I feel really guilty, but I honestly probably did not want to do the thing anyways. If I really want to follow through on a promise, I do; but, since I forgot to here, I must have not cared enough. Nevertheless, I feel guilty because I know that I have hurt someone else. ","I received the award for creating some sort of product, whether academic or musical. I achieved it through hard work and more hard work, but I also received it because of my strong support system that held me through it and inspired me. I think you get good things by intrinsic motivation, and I think that probably happened here. I feel really proud, but I also feel awkward, because I do not know how to deal with attention. "
49285,"I'd assume it was coincidence. I probably dreamed about them because they were on my mind that day. I seek a lot of support from my loved ones, so it makes sense that I'd dream about an exchange like that. I also dream about them frequently as it is.","I think this would happen if I met someone very perceptive and emotionally mature. I tend to be fairly good at reading people, so if I met someone who was also good at reading people I imagine we'd understand each other fast. Psych majors tend to be like that, so I probably met this hypothetical person in class.","I'm not sure why they're angry with me; presumably it would be because of something I'd done that had hurt or irritated them. I make a pretty active effort to avoid doing things that make other people angry, but for argument's sake my lack of reliability (ie constantly being late to things) is one of my more irritating traits. Typically when people are angry with me, I feel very small and afraid, and default to assuming they're in the right. I'm working on that, though--thanks, therapy!","I received the award for something career-related, probably. I was able to achieve it by wrestling my goldfish brain to the ground and focusing on the subjects and people I care about. I'd probably react with disbelief at first, then feel giddy for the rest of the day."
71619,"I feel like this would be most likely to happen to me if I knew the their time was close. I think I would be more likely to be consciously or unconsciously thinking about this person and the emotion would be more likely to come up in my dreams. For example, I know that my grandparents are getting much older, so the love I feel for them is tinged with a bit of sadness when I think of them, because I know that I only have so much time left to spend with them. I think subtle feelings like this are likely to come up in dreams.
","I think sometime people just ""click."" For example, this is how my mom described falling in love with my dad. It wasn't love at first sight; that would be infatuation or lust. But she has told me that their first conversation, it was the first time she had ever talked to someone who saw the world exactly the same way she did and totally understood her. I do believe that God has designed soulmates for some people to fall in love with, and that they are created to complement each other. ","I imagined someone was angry with me because I failed in some way. I felt shame and anxiety. I felt like I could not escape the situation, and worried that I could do nothing to improve the situation. I also felt upset that I had lost some of the person's trust and frustrated with myself because I would take time to rebuild that trust.","I imagined I received an award for pioneering some kind of medical advancement, perhaps a new discovery or innovative surgery. This is inline with my career goals. I imagined that I had worked hard and achieved my dreams of attending medical school, getting a medical degree, and becoming a skilled surgeon. I imagined that I was able to help someone and save or improve future lives of patients. I felt proud and excited."
92366,"I am going nuts because I don't understand how this kind of coincidence happened. It's likely just a coincidence. It's not like some exterior force or spirit made this happen, it's just life. Sometimes weird, connected things happen at the same time.","Her name is Nia and we are on a green Tamarack going to Agree Outpost Camp in Ontario, Canada in 2018. Within the first 5 minutes of the 8 hour bus ride, we are talking non-stop to each other and laughing so hard. A counselor comes up to us and asks us how long we have known each other and I respond with, ""we literally just met."" We are two outgoing, kind girls who happened to share an instant connection with each other. It's a coincidence. ","They are likely angry with me because I said ""went too far"" and expressed myself too much. I likely said something that was extremely direct and hurt their feelings (I have no filter). I feel extremely guilty about this situation now and cannot let go. I can't sleep, I can't do my homework; all I can do is replay the situation in my head and wish i could take back those words.","I just received an award for top 3rd overall female (age 15-19) of the Charlotte Turkey Trot 8k race. I won this award by running the race in 30:05 minutes. I feel so proud of myself and full of joy and excitement. I honestly feel on top of the world, like I can do anything. "
71589,"I think this happens as a result of God's influence. I am religious, but aside from these beliefs I also think that some things happen for a reason. Maybe this is fate, maybe it is a serendipitous occurrence, but regardless I don't think this would happen without there being an intention or purpose. I think this happens in order for those who lose loved ones to find closure. I also think this may be God's way of providing comfort to people in situations like these, since there is nothing anyone living can really do to ""fix"" the issue. ","I think this again would happen as a result of God's influence and intentions. I do believe that God puts people in our lives in order to help and positively impact others, so this may be the way that this starts. I also think sometimes individuals that are well-suited for one another may be in the same places because of similarities. ","I would imagine someone is angry with me because I offended them unintentionally. I think that this may be the case because often I say things before I truly think of the full impact that they may have on others. I don't mean to offend or hurt others, and so this is something that I am constantly trying to avoid and prevent from occurring. I would feel very guilty and upset with myself. ","I received an award for becoming a partner in a law firm in my dream area. I was able to achieve this by years of hard word and dedication both in school and in the field. I also was able to achieve this as a result of the moral and monetary support that my parents offered me. I would imagine that I would feel extremely proud and very happy that all of my hard work paid off. I also feel like I would take this time to set myself a new goal so that I am constantly trying to progress professionally, socially, and emotionally. "
77781,"It is situations like this that make me believe there probably is a higher power or doubt atheism. I think that the frequency of this occurring is not coincidental and probably occurs as a result of a higher power. I believe in souls, so I think perhaps this could be a visit from a person's soul before they go to an afterlife, if there is one, or just die for good. I definitely do not have a concrete answer for this one and there still is a great deal of confusion surrounding this for me.   ",I believe in reincarnation of souls so perhaps I did know this person in another life. I do not think that we would share memories of a previous life but it could be possible that our souls knew each other. This could also be a random coincidence and have nothing to do with souls or reincarnation because sometimes you just really click with a person right off the bat. ,"The first thing that comes to mind with this scenario is someone, probably my mother, would be angry at me for being angry at them or because I got aggressively passionate about something. There have been times where I ostracize people in my life after arguments, most likely political, and they tend to get angry due to my reaction, which would most likely be anger or passion that could come out as anger. I would likely feel angry at the person if I felt their anger was unfounded but if I actually did something wrong, I feel I am not bad at taking responsibility for my actions and apologizing.  ","If I received an award, it would likely be academic or for something to do with my Russian program as I do not do any other award-worthy activities. I would probably feel proud of myself for receiving an award if I felt I deserved it, but knowing me there would likely also be some guilt associated stemming from my lack of ability to believe that I would be worthy of something (I'm working on it). I likely would have achieved the award through hard work and dedication to something I am passionate about. "
62763,I believe this can happen out of pure coincidence sometimes. Our dreams can be very random from time to time so it makes sense that a random family member could suddenly visit us in a dream and give us some life advice. It is a crazy coincidence with a small chance of it happening but I think it can indeed happen and can be very offputting when it does. Sometimes dreams have a weird way of being very connected to our real lives as well but if there was truly no indication or background feeling that a distant family member may pass then it was just a coincidence.,"I think this phenomenon can happen from this new person having similar facial features that you may subconsciously recognize from someone you've actually known for many years. This could also happen from sharing the same personality traits or family characteristics with the new person and therefore you both have a lot in common and can feel comfortable around each other. Other than these two possibilities I am not sure why else this phenomenon could happen. I have personally never had this happen to me so I can't exactly say why this happens, I can only take a few good guesses.","Someone is angry with me because I do not know what my exact future career/job is yet. What led them to be angry is that college can be very expensive and if you don't have a plan then you could spend years in college wasting thousands of dollars. I feel upset that this person is angry with me, I am consistently trying to figure out what I want to be in the future but it also isn't the easiest decision to make. I am a very indecisive person so when it comes to something as big as my entire future I can change my mind a lot or become unsure of what I really want. ",I received the award for my outstanding work on a project. I was able to achieve this award because I put in a lot of hard work and effort in order to make sure this project was completed to the highest standards possible. I feel very happy about receiving this award. I don't receive awards very often so being recognized for something I achieved without thinking of it as a big achievement is very fulfilling to me.
45094,I think this would happen if you subconsciously miss them and feel like their presence is lacking in your life. This could be the universe's way of allowing you to let go emotionally before you realize they are physically gone. One last fond memory and advice is something that you can use in the future and apply their wisdom to future obstacles so that it feels like they are walking with you.,"This may happen if they have a very similar personality to someone you know. In my experience, this also happens when I share something unique to my life and the person responds very receptively, empathetically, and emotionally to me. After that, if you can spend a very long time with them and it feel natural then it would feel like you've know them forever.",I think someone would be angry with me if they misunderstood me. I can express things in an misleading tone and have unexpressive facial expressions which may not convey my true feelings. They would feel angry because they thought I was angry. I would feel frustrated and upset because people always misunderstand me and this creates a rift.,I would like to receive an award for being an empathetic friend. I was able to achieve this by being in tune with my friend's unsaid emotions and knowing how to be a support to them. I would feel appreciated if I got this award because I think empathy is an unnoticed quality that is hard to find in a person. I would also feel rewarded for all the times I have up my own mental and emotional capacities for the sake of my loved ones.
16925,"I feel like our bodies or minds are connected more to our loved ones than we realize. For example, my great grandmother who I was close with died and I had dreams of her and especially after getting a bracelet of hers that I wear a lot. I call it my good luck bracelet. It could also be because you are just close to this person.","I would have a sense of familiarity with them and as if I knew them before. More likely, it would be where I meet them constantly at like a library or in class we both go to. It could also be the same for them, or we end up meeting only once. I think that would be amazing since I did have the sense of deja vu a few times in my life.   ","I would say that they are angry at me for not being able to fix what they need into my schedule. I was unable to do a task of theirs because I was so busy with my own to do, and didn't get to do theirs. I would say I feel annoyed because they can easily do their task. It is not only up to me to do something of theirs.","I received the award for the best new writer in the Hussman school. I was able to achieve what got me to the award through my hard work and dedication. I would feel amazing and proud of myself for getting it. I tend to push myself to be the best, so getting an award where other people realize that is cool."
93965,"In my family, it is not uncommon to have a dream about a a relative who just happens to live far away and then soon after learn the news that they have passed. To me, I have always seen it as a warning or heads up. A way to prepare for what is about to come. How this happens? No clue but it does reinforce this idea that we are all somehow connected.","I have been fortunate enough to feel this a few time with people who I was only able to know for a short while. I think there are just some people who we vibe with on some frequency where it feels natural. Again, maybe it's do to some cosmic connection in relation to the universe but it is special and I cherish them. It is sad that they don't usually last but I try to remind myself to be happy that those interactions happened.","Maybe I said or did something to hurt their feelings! I am so sorry! Even though I didn't intent to hurt them, I know words have a heavy impact! I would like to apologize and make an effort to never phrase what i said to them in that way again.",I have received an award for a short documentary that I filmed in and with the local community. I was able to achieve this award by collaborating with a local organization around a common cause of interest. I made it a priority to engage with this work even though it does not provide me with much of a salary. I am proud of the work I did and that I stuck with it.
36842,"Various scenarios come to mind as to why this could have happened; one is pure coincidence, perhaps you were thinking about them during the day, and in your dreams your subconsciousness worked it in. There have also been instances of close individuals, such as twins, experiencing an almost psychological connection, like feeling pain in a body part the other twin hurt. There could be a connection of that type with the close person, though I would not know how or why it occurs. ","A possibility could be a close resemblance to something; perhaps you had a friend earlier in life who looked similar or has similar traits, and while you lost contact with that friend, this individual heavily reminds you of them, giving a sense of nostalgia/familiarity. Perhaps you may have dreamed of someone similar, or imagined a person with similar traits/looks, also giving that sense of familiarity. ","I found many instances of anger towards myself stemming from miscommunications. Often times I find myself thinking one thing, but when I try to phrase it it comes out in a different manner which can be misconstrued. I generally feel surprise and guilt when I realize i caused a negative emotion in a person, and attempt to rephrase my thoughts to deescalate the situation. ","Hypothetically, I could receive an award for personal self-improvement. Prior to Covid, I was a reserved individual with some traits that I was not proud of. During lock-down, I put in work to improve myself and push myself to change the non-ideal traits and shyness, and to be more social following the end of lock-down. I think that overall I definitely went through noticeable improvement, though I still have some ways to go. "
85953,"If my loved one was sick, I would understand why I would have a dream about them, especially one where they give me advice they would not be able to tell me in their current state. I think this happens because if someone we love and look up to is unwell, we start to think about all the things we want to say to them before they pass away, as well as what they might want to say to us. ","If I had the sense that I knew someone for decades upon meeting them for the first time, it would be because we have a similar sense of humor and way of explaining things/stories. My closest friends, some of which I have not known for more than a few months, have similar mannerisms and ways of telling jokes and stories as I do, and I think that is a big part of why we get along so well. When you can easily laugh and keep conversation with someone for long periods of time, you get the sense that you have known them for much longer than you have. ","If someone was angry with me, it would likely be one of my parents. I haven't had a conflict with any of my friends in a very long time, so I don't know what they would be angry at me about. In regard to my parents, they would probably be mad at me for forgetting to do something I said I would do (probably several times). When this happens, the issue is usually resolved when I finally do whatever I was supposed to.The conflict doesn't last very long, and neither my parents nor I dwell on it. It doesn't have an impact on my mood or feelings. ","I would receive the award for something related to sports, likely running. I would achieve this award after months of consistently training, taking proper care of my body, and being an active member of whatever team I am running on. While I would feel proud about achieving the award in the moment, that satisfaction would probably fade pretty quickly, as I tend to trivialize most if not all of my achievements. "
99276,"I think our minds sometimes create things we may need or want to hear, even sometimes things we might not want to hear! Perhaps the grandparent's spirit is visiting you in your sleep, but I am not sure on how I exactly feel about that.","I experience things like this a lot, I think when our minds recognize faces oftentimes they can get confused or blended together.",They are angry with me because I am not trying to be better like I said I would. They became angry with me because I was crying and not trying to pull myself out of it. I feel defeated and like I have failed.,I received an award for my work in chemistry. I was the first chemist to finally help create a viable solution to the plastic pollution crisis. Thousands of pounds of plastic waste can now be used and upcycled into value-added materials. I was able to achieve this by the love and support of my family and my boyfriend. I am proud of myself and feel accomplished. 
82483,I do not believe in outside forces but I think if it was  close friend or relative I would pay attention closely. I think it may have happened because deep down we all are connected in some fashion. Things like thinking of people at the same time and calling them is some form of what happened with this dream. ,"I think it really has to do with finding something that you connected on. This could be a memory that you both have in common, a place, a hobby, or anything that you both have in common. Another way that could happen is being emotionally connected. Having someone who digs a bit deeper to connect beyond the superficial idea is really important. ",They are angry because if a miscommunication or because I overstepped my boundaries of what a friend does. By being overprotective I may have stepped into a role that I should not have. I feel awful about the situation but also recognize that the role of friends for every person is different. ,"If I were imagining myself getting an award it would be for service,creating an organization that helped hundreds of people and for an program that addresses root and upstream problems. I would have been able to achieve it by working with mentors and having a drive to make a change. Getting it feels like an unparalleled high. There is nothing like working hard for something you are passionate about and someone recognizing it when that was never your intention. "
79340,"I don't think there is a reason for this happening, beyond a coincidence. But, I would treasure the advice I received in the dream out of memory for the loved one. If the dream felt real, it would essentially be my last memory of that person. The dream sounds like a good memory, so it would be a good way to remember that loved one. ","I think this might happen if people have similar life experiences. If you have been through similar things and have similar personalities, you might feel like you have known someone for a long time because they are similar to yourself. This would make it really easy to get along with them because you feel like you know them already since you know yourself. I don't think there is a reason why this would happen other than coincidence. ","Someone might be angry at me for being stubborn. I imagine it is a close family member who I have a different opinion to about something, probably not an important topic. In the moment I would feel frustrated with them for being angry at me, but later I would be frustrated with myself for not being more open to another opinion. I think I have experienced situations like this before, and it has led me to be less stubborn over time. ",I received some sort of academic award. I was able to achieve it by being a good student and studying a lot. I would be happy about getting it but it wouldn't be the motivation for my hard work. The pride of the award would go away quickly but the feeling of knowing how hard I worked would be more long-lasting. 
58555,"The deceased family member was visiting me before going to heaven. They visited me because they regretted not telling me this wisdom when they were alive. They wanted their last memory of them to be memorable and to say their final goodbye in ""person."" It is a sign of how much they loved me. ","I don't really believe in a past life, so I think this would happen due to shared values. I believe that everything happens for a reason from a religious perspective (Christian), so I would think that God led me to this person. This would be to fulfill a certain purpose. ","They are angry with me because they caught me in a lie. I am involved in a friendship with a person who has a very anxious attachment style. She is always asking me to hangout and it seems like her happiness depends on me, which I find very emotionally burdening. Sometimes, I lie about what I am doing for the sake of my own mental health. I would feel guilty, but at the same time, I wish they would get the message.",I just received an award for graduating in the top of my class. I was able to achieve the award by consistently working hard in all of my classes for 4 years. I also sacrificed other typical college experiences like spring break to work toward my goals. I feel very proud of myself and do not regret the hard work of the past because I know my efforts will help me get into graduate school. 
26708,"Oh I might feel really bad if my far-away loved one passed away. But yes, I find this situation to be reasonable because although I don't know the underlying reason behind this, I feel like there's always some mutual connections between people. If you are happy with someone through one experience, the other person would probably feel the same. We are all social people, and we thrive through positive connections with others. ","I think this happens because we share something in common. In short, you feel that that person knows you. I think this might have happened because you normally have friends like that person, or you have some dreams in which you are accompanied with people like that person (the friendship you always look for, the person who truly understands you).","They are angry with me for my not being able to share my thoughts, or just hiding away. Sometimes, when I feel really stressed out after a terrible conversation and I feel like I cannot receive understanding from that person, I would just stop talking. I cannot proceed on the conversation because I'm in a guarded mindset and I feel really bad myself. I would feel that this situation is the worst, so I wouldn't enjoy talking with someone who are super judging and not understanding -- usually authority, or somebody who doesn't understand me but criticizes me. ","I don't want to receive a reward for something super fancy -- I expect it to be for my sticking to my choice and take full responsibility of it. Personally, I am an INTJ, so I would stick to my choice most of the time because I often find my own judgment after rational thoughts is reliable. And often times, I wouldn't change my mind unless others' thoughts are logically convincing. I might be really proud of getting the award because that's always what I seek after, and I will be happy if I receive some understandings. "
31579,"This can happen when someone has a special bond with another person. These special bonds bring people closer together and allows them to be ""in sync"". Another reason this can happen is spirituality. Some people believe that spirits can inhabit your dreams.",I think this happened because these people have something in common. For example having a common culture. When two people have something in common they have a way to connect. These connections help people feel closer to one another.,This person is probably mad at me because I gave them attitude. My family has told me in the past that I have an attitude problem. Sometimes it is hard for me to control. I try to be more self-aware and watch the way I speak to people.,I received an award for CNA of the month at my job. I was able to achieve this award because I treat all of my patients with respect and I am very patient and caring towards them. I feel great about achieving this award because I love what I do. This award will fortify my desire to work in healthcare.
83629,"I would think that this happened because I likely had something in the previous days that reminded me of that individual (i.e. saw a photo, smelled a scent I associate with them, etc). I think this type of event happens because your brain wants to make subliminal connections and try to make events meaningful. I also think that this is a way for your brain to cope with extreme emotions. ","I would think that the person in question has attributes that I found to be important to me in the past with other friends and they remind me of that/those person/people. The attributes likely would initially start off as physical (i.e. hair, eyes, accent, speech, dress) then as the conversation progressed would then go to more personality based characteristic traits. I think these types of interactions happen because subliminally your mind is always picking up cues that your conscious mind is unaware of and then makes a relationship between those attributes that you were unaware of, and then brings them to your attention by giving you an uncanny sense of knowing each other for a long period of time.  ","They are angry with me because I missed a deadline or forgot something I was supposed to do for them. They feel a sense of disappointment and frustration with me, which led them to the secondary emotion of anger. What led me failing to meet their expectations was likely a mismanagement of time and availability on my part (i.e. taking off too much to chew at one time) which led to the inevitable failure in meeting the deadline. I would likely feel disappointment and frustration in myself an a sense of shame that I didn't live up to my expectations of myself nor the expectation of others. ",I just received an award for my dedication to helping others. I was able to achieve the award by showing up and being present to my coworkers and fellow classmates every day. These people felt comfortable enough with me and with my interest in their well-being and success to collectively nominate me for this award. I feel humbled receiving the award with a sense of affirmation and rejuvenation when I find out that my peers nominated me for the position and that my actions are sending the correct message in how I want others to think of me and that I try to live my life like. 
11221,"I believe that if this happened, my entire life view would change. My religious beliefs run thin if at all and my scientific side is very prominent but if something like this happened, I would feel very lucky to have my grandparent not only visit me, but impart some sort of knowledge before passing on. I also feel as though if it made sense to, I would pass the knowledge onto others and especially those that need to hear it assuming it makes sense with their situation.","I was just sitting down at the park while my dog was playing and right next to me was a man who had  calm look to his face. He glanced over and asked me how I was doing that day and the second he did, that's when I felt a connection without ever giving a response. We started talking and I realized we had much more in common than I thought. He's a geologist and I'm a physicist so we had similar schooling backgrounds. But it was the rigor and hardships we had both been through that characterized our conversation.",They are angry with me because I expressed why I didn't want to go to the event with them. They felt as though me just not wanting to go that night was enough for them to become frustrated with me and argue about what I should and should not be doing that night. I felt very restricted when they said this and almost as if I wasn't allowed to have my own schedule. I still question why it is that people get angry when I try to have my own independence.,I received an award for making an astounding breakthrough in our understanding of dark matter and the role it plays in our universe. I was able to achieve this award by working closely with others and spending countless hours running experiments and collecting data. I could not have done it alone however and the knowledge my colleagues provided to me made it possible for me to make this discovery. I feel a great sense of achievement and pride for being able to make such a discovery and I'm very thankful for those that helped me achieve this.
35670,"This has actually happened to me before, but they come visit me after they've passed. I'm a spiritual person, so I believe this happens because your loved one recognizes that you need their support in that moment. I think some part of the universe recognizes that this loved one is important to you, so they send them over to impart some last wisdom. Also, I think this is a way for relatives or the universe to tell you that you are not alone and that you are able to face the battles that come your way. ","I think that this may happen because of having good chemistry and being able to relate and connect over various topics. This probably happened because we also had similar mindsets and goals; I think this is really helpful when connecting with someone new. Also, having the ability to laugh with someone really helps create this feeling of ""having an old friend.""","If someone is angry with me, it is probably because I said something that was not very kind. I have the tendency to speak before I think when I feel threatened or hurt. So, if they're angry, they're angry at what I said because it was offensive. I feel really bad about the entire situation. I often feel really guilty when someone is mad at me because I know I did something wrong and I could have avoided the situation if I had thought through my words a bit more.","I just received an award for my dedication to public service. I dedicated my life to serving the community and centering their voices in the work that I do. I was able to achieve this by listening to what community members had to say about different public issues.

I feel really good about receiving this award because I like being recognized for my hard work, especially something I'm passionate about."
50144,"If this happened to me, I would see it as something very meaningful because I usually don't remember my dreams enough to explain them to someone the next day or write them down. I might think that my loved one visited me in a dream to say goodbye to me and leave me with words of wisdom before they moved on to some sort of afterlife or ceased to exist. I would hold these words very close to my heart and believe that they were things I was supposed to hear. ","I feel an immediate spark of connection with this new person because we have enough in common to relate to each other about shared experiences, but we are also different enough to be interesting to each other. We never run out of things to talk about - I am curious about them and eager to get to know them more. It feels like I have known them for as long as I can remember because we have similar experiences and can talk about them openly. It feels like they have been through many of the same things as I have, just in slightly different contexts. ","In this hypothetical situation, my friend is angry with me because I have been neglecting to talk to her recently. Since I have been busy recently and have started dating someone new (and thus have been spending a lot of time with them), my friend has gotten more and more upset as I don't reach out as much and sometimes bail when we make plans. I feel upset and guilty about the situation because I haven't been meaning to neglect my friend. I understand why she is upset and wish that I had known what was happening before she got upset. ","I received an award for my dedication to service. Particularly, I have done a lot of work related to disability justice in college (working with the disabled community, writing my Honors Thesis on a disability-justice-related topic, running a student organization related to this cause), and this award recognizes my efforts. I feel happy and honored to receive this award, but simultaneously weird because I don't feel like I should be praised for engaging in service - I see service as my way to give back to the world and feel a strong sense of duty to pursue what I'm passionate about.

Regardless of whether or not it was the result of coincidence or some deeper spiritual connection, knowing that the ones we love love us too is important and comforting.","I think that this would have happened because that person and I have shared similar life experiences. We may have grown up in similar circumstances, and/or our identities may be similar in a way that closens us. I think, furthermore, that for this to happen, each of us has to take an interest in the other (notice the similarities). I can't say why exactly something like this might have happened, apart from coincidence.","They're angry with me because I haven't considered their feelings as I should have. I might have offended them because I wasn't paying attention to things that they valued or something else. I feel guilty and somewhat frustrated.

Furthermore, I feel that something I do purely creatively and without any expectation of reward is being appreciated."
62768,"I would view this interaction as some kind of strong spiritual connection between myself and this person. I am religious, so I suppose that an explanation for this could be that they were communicating with me from an afterlife. However, if this scenario really happened, I don't know if this is the conclusion I would actually jump to. I would probably try to rationalize why this happened logically by saying that there was likely some other event that triggered this thought in my mind. ","Similarly to the question about the relative who communicated with me via dream, I would likely have two different, conflicting reactions. On the one hand, I like to believe in soulmates and the idea that people can connect immediately upon meeting each other; I do believe in fate and the idea that everything happens for a reason, so maybe I was destined to meet this person. On the other hand, I could rationalize and pass this interaction off as this person simply reminding me of somebody else in my life that I have known for decades. In all likelihood, I think we attract people with certain attributes. ","This person is likely angry with me because of some error in communication or planning. For example, we made plans and I forgot to attend or was late; the people in my life are very patient and forgiving, so for somebody to be genuinely angry with me indicates that I made a big mistake. I would feel guilty if it were this situation of forgetting plans, and in general would be very uneasy with someone being angry with me, so I would do my best to communicate with them and solve the issue as soon as possible.","I likely would have received an award for some kind of accomplishment within one of the social communities in which I participate (ex. Carolina for the Kids, my sorority Pi Beta Phi, the medical fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon). In order to achieve this award, I would have had to made a contribution to the organization beyond what other members were doing. For example, in Carolina for the Kids, I might receive recognition for the amount of fundraising that I did for the children's hospital. I would be thrilled to receive this award, because it is a tangible recognition of the work that I had put into the organization."
41401,i like to imagined that this happened because this significant figure has played an important part of your role either growing up with you personally or helping you with your darkest times. or neither yet they made you feel happy in certain ways and you find comfort in their presence. the fact that they came over to your and exclaimed life wisdom meant that your impact on them is also significant. they had spent their last moments breathing just to talk with you and share their stories with you too. it's very heart-touching and that they will always have a special place in your heart. ,"i like to believe that this 'mutual feeling' has happened because you have sensed a familiar feeling in the atmosphere. whether or not this person was someone that you have know for a very long time or not, the sense of closure brings it all together. because you were so familiar with their presence, and once knew their tastes in things like their favourite colour or weather. all of the misc facts you once knew about them had suddenly disappeared only to be brought back my a shadow. it's the tenderness in your heart that you once reminiscence. ","a common reason why people are angry with me is because i did something wrong towards myself. i refused to open up about my issues with them or i neglect to induced a benefit onto myself. thus this person is angry at me - more of my behaviour onto myself than myself as a person. i felt awful that they are expressing this emotion onto me. it is a very hateful, red, and dark aura and i feel bad that they had to ruined their day with anger of me. i tried to look back at the issues that i made and reflect on that. ",i imagined myself receiving an award for my dedication for art! art was one of my passions thus i took extra time and dedication to be more creative. i visited my art teacher after school and talked with her about my ideas. and this was something that i enjoyed doing growing up and was not forced upon to do it. i would feel very excited and happy because this award was recognized from my hard work and passion. it brings a sense of awe towards art. 
85043,"Perhaps subconsciously you knew that they were close to their death and your mind tried to protect you and bring you comfort by imagining them in your dream. You conjure up an image of them in your mind as a way of coping with the fact that you know they might be gone, and imagine them giving you life wisdom. It might help you feel more closure towards their death in general. ","Perhaps they were raised in a similar environment to me and we have very similar ways of thinking about things that just make us click. They might come from a similar background to me as well. Or they might just have an open mind and know how to communicate well with me, so that we both feel like we've known each other for a very long time. ","I imagine someone might be angry with me perhaps because of something I said. I don't quite understand the question, but I wouldn't want someone to be angry with me and would probably feel quite guilty. I would most likely try to fix the situation unless I felt like I had been wronged and was also angry with them. ",I might've received the award for something in mathematics. Hopefully it's further in my career where I've become better at studies and make some sort of furthering in that field. I think I would feel very accomplished about getting it and would be very happy as well. 
46483,I think this happened because they have passed away but want to leave you the last words before they go. I am a somewhat spiritual person and I believe in the life after-death. Dream is one way that death people and alive people communicate. They miss you and they want to communicate with you. ,"I think this has, in fact, happened to me before. Our conversations flow so easily and effortlessly. We also have a lot of mutual friends. The 20 minutes conversation for the first time we met felt like we have known each other for years. It is a great feelings and it is probably because how similar we are and the friends we have in common. ","People normally don't get angry at me. I'm rarely in those situations. But if it were to happened, it is probably because I started getting mad at them first and being mean to them. I'm normally calm but if I'm mad, I'm very very mad. So if they are angry at me, it is probably because I'm not being nice to them. ",I would feel honored receiving the award. I think the award I receive would be outstanding person/teammate when it comes to community building. I like talking to people and go out of my way to make sure that everyone feel safe and happy. 
81812,"My grandfather visited me in a dream and assured me that I am capable of anything. Then, he died of ongoing illness. I think that this happened because my subconscious was probably already coping with his soon-to-come passing. What he told me was probably what my brain knew I needed to hear.","When we met, there was no awkward tension in our conversation; it flowed. We shared a sense of humor and perspectives about different complex situations. We felt like we'd known each other for decades because everything we said to one another was relatable, like we were having a conversation with ourselves.","They are angry with me because I accidentally forgot to invite them to a dinner party I hosted. More deeply, they are angry because they have underlying feelings about being a misfit and I have just struck a nerve. I feel incredibly guilty. I also feel incredibly anxious about resolving the situation and impatient to let them know that it was unintentional.","I received an award for being charismatic and kind. I was able to achieve the award by showing respect and compassion towards others. Theoretically, the ""others"" had some type of a vote. I feel proud."
82872,"I think it happens because we have emotional connections. If I am worried about someone far-away, it can be possible that I have a dream like this. But I will still feel sad with a little bit comfort from the dream.","If I meet someone for the first time, sharing a lot of things about ourselves with each other and having similar experiences or similar feelings toward a same situation would be a way we share an uncanny sense that we've known each other for decades. I think this happened because we have similar values and beliefs. ","I think maybe because I did something make them feel sad or uncomfortable. For example, may be I organized a party but did not invite them. I think they will be angry with me after they figured out. Personally, I feel guilty when someone is angry with you, even though sometimes I did nothing and it was a misunderstanding. ","Probably because of accomplishment, such as I joined in a competition and I won an award. I will feel happy and proud if I receive an award in that way. "
29198,"This is most likely a coincidence. This far-away loved one was likely sick and, in focusing on them, your subconscious mind has conjured happy memories and thoughts about them. This is a way to connect them with how you remember them vs the present situation. Since they have been in your thoughts recently and you are concerned, it is natural for your subconscious to try to work through your emotions by dreaming.",Sometimes you meet people and you click with them. You know inherently that this person is a match for you in some way. I feel content and at ease with them even though you've never met. Connecting with them and sharing personal stories is natural and you know that you will be close for life.,They're angry at me because I didn't leave earlier to get the car (which is a 45 minute walk away). It is now 5:00 and we have a 3 and 1/2 hour drive ahead of us. This has set us back because but we were unsure if we were going on the trip or not. I am sad that they're frustrated because this trip was supposed to be fun. I am also slightly irritated however as our poor communication resulted in this situation as the other person was wishy washy on whether or not we were going on the trip.,I received an award for having a high GPA (4.00). I was able to achieve this award through hard work and dedication. School was mainly my priority and I studied and worked hard to achieve my goal. I am excited and happy to have achieved such an award.
41041,"I'm not the most spiritual person but I don't think there are any logical explanations for why this may happen. My guess would be that their essence was trying to comfort and communicate with me. Another guess would be an extremely rare coincidence. Unfortunately, I don't remember my dreams as often as I used to so I'm not even sure if I would remember it.",I'm absolutely horrible at remembering people so something like this could very well happen to me if the person was a longtime aquaintance. I do have pretty good instincts though and I can usually have some vague recognition even if I haven't seen them for a long time or directly remember them. I might also relate this person back to another person I'm already familiar with if they look similar.,"There's a lot of reasons people have been angry with me. Probably the most relevant one right now would be if I forgot a meeting with them. I'm very forgetful and am not the greatest at writing things down. I'd feel really guilty about forgetting unless they yell at me, then I would also get angry and defensive.","If I received an award, it would probably be related to something academic. I can't think of anything exact. In order to achieve academic success, I would need to learn how to focus and manage my time better. I would definitely be very excited and proud of my award since I'm a success oriented person."
84440,"I feel as though this would happen as a part of my loved one's departure. I would know that my dream was a part of their last goodbye, and I would utilize every bit of wisdom they shared with me in my dream. I think that this is definitely a realistic scenario as I believe in the afterlife.","I think that I would feel this way about a person if we connected really easily. If we began to talk about topics and had very similar opinions on those topics, I would feel very connected. Along with this, the mood of the conversation would also change how I felt about the person. If the mood of the conversation was super upbeat and engaging, I feel as though the scenario presented in this question would feel real.","Someone is probably angry with me because of the way I said something. Although it depends on the person, it is still very difficult for me to hide my emotions, especially the negative ones. Thus, if I am in a bad mood, I will often unknowingly lash out on someone or give them an attitude. This would rightfully cause someone to be angry with me, which would remind me that this is something I need to work on.","If I were to receive an award right now it would probably be for my recognition within one of the clubs I participate in. I am a part of Dream on 3, which is a club where the group collectively works together to raise money to make a disabled child's dream come true. The dream is related to sports, so we usually fly the child out to meet their favorite player of a team. I put a lot of time into this club, so I imagine that this would be something I would get an award for."
59678,"I do not feel like there is a correlation between the two just because there is no scientific evidence dreams translate to reality. However, I do feel like perhaps I was going through something personal I was struggling with and needed a figure to spearhead my growth. To me, I would feel like them passing away would motivate me further to become a better person and resolve my issues. I would also feel sad but know they are in a better place. ","If we are able to connect on a deep topic such as family trauma, relationship struggles or professional aspirations and are able to talk about it for an extended period of time, then I feel connected to them. There is just this aura about the other person that makes it easy to open up and be vulnerable. Aspects such as being an active listener and always smiling definitely would make it more comfortable to ask questions and be introspective. Also, having non awkward silences or feeling normal about silences is important. ","I can see my father getting angry at me for various reasons. One of them being our differences in how we approach perspectives on life. For example, although to him my room is messy, I know where everything is and can find it despite it not looking conventionally clean. Thus, he would ask me to clean my room but I would not want to just because I am content with its appearance. However, to him, it is seen as being lazy. ","I received the award for either Asian American violence awareness or acts of service. Throughout my time in college, I have been active in various cultural organizations on campus as well as volunteering/becoming service chairs for extracurriculars as well. Getting an award is a testament to my efforts but I also feel like its significance is only so much because it is of material value. Gaining validation from the community and seeing progress is what is important. "
16861,"I believe that this happens to give people a sense of closure that they may have otherwise not received. When people die, their spirits are able to communicate with people who they have felt connected to throughout their life. I feel like this can happen through dreams, gut feelings, and deja vu. Depending on the relationship you have with the other person, receiving their wisdom in a dream can be a reflection of your unconscious desire to please them or looking to them for approval. ","I love having this feeling with someone that I've just met! I feel like this happens because everyone has people that are meant to be in their life and meeting them is not just up to chance. In the grand scheme of live I believe that there are people whose lives compliment or parallel yours and that you're destined to meet them. On a less philosophical avenue, people tend to frequent places where others share similar common interests like sports events or music festivals of artists you both enjoy. ",Someone is angry with me because I have expressed an opinion or thought that they didn't agree with or necessarily want to hear. An honest conversation about a conflict in their life led them to be angry with you. I feel a little bit anxious but mostly slightly frustrated about the situation. I'm anxious that they are upset with me but frustrated that they don't understand my point of view. ,"I received an award for developing a drug that helps cure various mental illnesses without any side effects. I was able to achieve what brought me to the award through the support of my mother, my family, and the many mentors that have given me a chance and pushed me along my professional journey. I feel amazing and like I can finally breath after receiving the award. All the long nights of studying and long hours spent ridden with anxiety were finally worth it. "
11003,I think this could happen because subconsciously you are thinking about them and wanting to connect with them. This might mean you have a sense of longing for them and you want to see them. ,I think this could be because this person that you have met is similar to someone that you have known before. They could be similar to a close friend or family member. It could also be that you simply are able to get to know each other very easily. ,This person is angry with me because I had forgot to do a task that I said I would do for them earlier. They are angry because they have told me to do this task before and I still have not done it. I feel very upset that they are mad at me but also feel it is understandable and I must do better.,I achieved the reward of kindest Sophomore at UNC- Chapel Hill. I think I would receive this award because I strive to be kind to everyone that I meet and try to uplift others as best I can. I feel very good about getting it but also don't feel like I am necessarily all positive underneath. I feel I have a lot of life issues weighing me down yet I am proud because I push on to try to be a nice person.
20638,I this could happen if they were sick and I knew they may die soon. I think the wisdom may be something they said when I was younger and it was stored somewhere in my subconscious and might reappear when I am thinking about them more often.,They likely look like someone I have already met and share a similar demeanor and personality. I might also be meeting them in a similar setting as where I met the other person. These factors can create a sense of familiarity. I could confuse this for having known the person already.,They are angry that I did not stay in touch with them after spending time away from one another. They feel like I should communicate with them more frequently. I feel hurt that they are mad at me and upset with myself that I did not do more. I would probably be apologetic and take blame for the situation.,I received the award for being a compassionate leader at my school. I achieved this award by holding a couple leadership positions on different clubs/teams. I feel grateful and excited for getting the award and that it will open up new doors for me.
68911,"I think family members have a mutual sense of compassion for each other, so when one of them is in trouble, the others will know something is wrong. I think that a loved one may visit in a dream to say their goodbye if they were unable to do it in person. This unexpected visit will give you peace of mind that your loved one is okay and cares for you even in their passing.  ","If I met someone for the first time but felt that I had known them for a while, it might be that I was very similar to the person. I find that when I am similar to another person, we ""click"" easily and understand each other even if we have not known each other for a long time. This could be because we share similar values or because we understand where the other is coming from. Either way, when you are similar to another person, it makes it seem like you have known them for a while even if you have not.","When someone is angry with me, it is usually because we disagree on a topic. When someone holds a particular value close to them, it can sometimes be difficult to disagree with someone that has different values. I feel upset when someone is angry at me because I do not like to cause a fight/disagreement. However, it is important that when people disagree, they do not become angry at each other but learn to respectfully disagree on the topic.","I received an award for my piano competition. I had to dedicate my time practicing the piano for months to be ready for the competition. I felt proud of myself for receiving the award because I know how much hard work it took to receive the award. Also, receiving the award motivates me to work even harder in the future to receive more rewards."
33817,I would believe that their soul had visited me during the night after they had passed. I am a very spiritual person and would think that there had to be a reason this dream would happen. I've heard stories about these situations and even had friends have spiritual dreams along this topic. I think their soul would be able to go into another realm/dream plane in order to visit.,"I think this person would hold qualities that are very similar to my close friends and maybe qualities that I wish my close friends had. I think this person and I would just have an instant bond by the manneurisms and the way we go about communicating to have this bond. I've had theories about past lives and reconnecting with those you were supposed to be with in those past lives, but I don't think I truly believe this.","Most commonly people are angry with me because I've hid something from them. They could find out from someone else and be angry that I've withheld this information from them. I would feel guilty and worried that I have lost trust with this person and that there is no way to recover or rebuild that relationship. I would try to justify my reasoning, but would probably end up with lies.",I would think that I received an award for my leadership skills in an organization I'm involved in. I have held many leadership roles and haven't really gotten recognized for the hard work I put into my projects and tasks. Being reward for this would be very nice and make me feel appreciated and grateful. I would feel loved by those in this organization for giving me this award.
16742,I think there is a great power that connects us together in the world. It can be religious or non-religious but things seem to happen for a reason. It would be something that science has not fully uncovered the true reason. I will be interesting to find out one day how that happens.,"I think there are some common connections between humans that are innate to our being. There are some experiences that can transcend cultures and environments. In addition, there are also people who approach things in a similar manner and connect based on the way we approach problems and situations that we could agree on. After the initial connection, there may be other factors that show each other compassion and trust where we would like to enjoy each other's time.",They could be angry due to miscommunication or unknowing selfishness. I also believe we sometimes tend to think about ourselves first. That is a nature of our existence and many times it would be a thoughtfulness exercise that someone would have to go through to train to be empathetic towards others first and listen actively. I would not be upset with them but rather would want to understand where the problem came about and if there was something I could do to help them feel less angry.,I think I would receive an award related to philanthropy or making an impact at work. I think rewards sometimes come at the most unexpected times and reasons. There may be some people who really sponsor your work and are rooting for your success. I believe that it would have been because of some impact that I have made in other's lives that was due to my compassion and hard work to reaching a goal. I would be genuinely grateful.
18059,I am religious so f this was to happen to me I would think it was God letting them speak to me and check in on me one last time before they died. ,If I met someone for the first time and we have a lot in common and click from the start then I would think it was a great coincidence and that we should try to do more together. I like to and want to have more friends and someone that you get along with is just wasted potential if you don't spend more time with them and grow that further. ,Someone would be angry with me for telling a little harmless lie when they knew the truth and knew what I was lying about. People would be angry with me because I do not pay attention in the best ways and get distracted in conversations. If I paid attention and didn't tell the little lies then it wouldn't happen as much but then also someone might get hurt if the truth hurts their feelings. I would feel upset but know I did wrong so I would understand that they were angry. ,I would received an award for the book that I am constantly rewriting and will never go further than to a little writing competition. If I did actually submit written work in a competition and received an award I would be happy and excited about it but also nervous because I am not sure I want it to go further or for more people to see it. 
69516,"Sometimes life is weird, and sometimes people just get feelings about something. And your head/brain takes that into considerations, so at night if you have a dream, a summation of what happened the previous day and what your body unconsciously feels affects your dreams. It was probably a coincidence.  ","It's just probably someone you've seen around, or you know someone that looks like them. I doubt you would have meet them in like a past life or something. It was just a connection you sometimes feel. Some people have that look about them that makes you feel like you've known them forever, and that you can talk to them.","They are probably mad at me because I didn't communicate something with them well enough. They don't understand how I feel and I don't know how they feel or how to fix it. I am probably really upset with myself for starting it this, and I am probably mad at them for not talking to me. I don't know what to do to make it better. I'm going to try and make it better and worry about how they feel. But I'll probably also be upset about how I feel and that I probably can do something to fix the situation, but I'm not doing enough. ","I received an award for being a researcher in chemistry. I studied a lot and researched new pathways of working with chemical equipment to bioengineer a human cell or gene to help with a disease or illness. I would feel proud, but I would probably also feel like imposter syndrome. I probably didn't do enough, or I would think that someone else deserves the award, not me."
73467,"I am not a spiritual or religious person; however, sometimes things like this happen for unexplained reasons. Or perhaps, there is a science behind it and you knew this person was sick, old, or lived a high risk lifestyle and were worried about them which manifested through a dream. I believe that dreams are manifestations of your emotions or things you are thinking about or working through. Therefore, a person visiting you in your dream and then learning they died may have just been your way of working through whatever is going on in your life. They might not even be connected.","When this occurs, I believe it indicates that you and this person have a lot of similarities or things that compliment each other to the point where you feel as if you've known them for years. I believe this happens because you can recognize qualities in another that you respect, see in yourself, or admire almost immediately. I have read that you make a judgement of someone in the first seven seconds you meet them.","If someone is angry with me, it is most likely due to a lack of communication about an issue. I do not often know how to communicate my emotions, problems, etc. They probably wanted me to say something or tell them something that I wasn't able to or didn't recognize that they wanted. I would probably be a little confused but also maybe angry as well depending on the severity of the situation.","I have received an award for my research. This has been a long journey, many hours, tears, and hard work so receiving recognition for it makes me feel happy and like all of the hard times were worth it. I achieved my award through work in the environmental science/biology field perhaps working with marine animals or even terrestrial ones learning more about how processes and larger things like climate change impact them. I did this work through learning new software programs, scientific instruments, how to structure a research design, and more."
47724,"I think my friend who lives in California visits to give wisdom because we spent two years becoming best friends and getting to know each other really well, but then separated for college and grew apart. We are still great friends but just not as close as when in high school. I think this is her way of telling me it's okay that we haven't kept in great touch because we are already connected so deeply. We had a great connection that will last a lifetime even when we are separated for forever. ","Since the first moment we started talking, there were no lapses in conversation. The conversation is about things we are both passionate about. We agree on most topics, and when we disagree, there is a mutual sense of respect and understanding. I think this happened because we have a lot in common and are both generally easy to talk to. ",This person is angry with me because I was too blunt in a situation. I said something too them that was harsh and did not consider their feelings. Sometimes I come across as harsh in situations that are meant to be more lighthearted. I feel disappointed in myself that I made another person angry with me. ,I received this award for science research in the lab I work in. I was able to achieve what brought me to this award because of my hard work and dedication to beginning in a lab. I feel proud and excited for getting an award because I know I have shown dedication and passion towards the project. 
27006,"I think that this would happen because of a divine intervention as a way to comfort me in my loved one's passing and also as a way for that loved one to be at peace knowing that I know what they wanted to tell me. I think while it would hurt initially, that it would comfort me in the long run. My grandmother had a similar expierience once and I have expierienced similar and I see it as a way that God may communicate with us as crazy as that may sound.","I think that this would happen because they likely remind me of someone I have known closely for a while and because they are able to carry a conversation with me very easily. I do not think there necessarily is a set reason that it happened, but it definitely could be a possibility that I was meant to meet this person to get to know or possibly to help get me through a certain season in my life. I believe that while some meetings may happen for a specific reason, others may just be to brighten your day or for something small.",They are probably angry with me because of a way I acted that did not consider their feelings in the matter or because I did not value their feelings as much as I should have. I probably said something that went too far and it was the final straw. I feel horrible about it because I know that it was my fault and at least partially was aware of what I was doing. I also likely feel defensive in this situation.,I probably would receive a reward for some kind of academic achievement. I was able to get this award by working and studying hard to achieve my goals. I feel purposeful and content with the award. the award serves as a reminder that my hard work paid off
18289,"I believe that God providentially imparts wisdom. I don't think that spirits can really communicate after death and attempts to contact the afterlife are usually demonic. 
So it could be the case that God providentially allowed you that experience, but it was not the spirit of the loved one. ","Sometimes people, due to similar upbringings and character, can be very in sync with each other from the moment they first meet. 
I don't think re-incarnation is a viable possibility. 
I think it makes sense psychologically that people who are quite similar to each other will feel emotionally compatible at an earlier time than the average couple does. ","They're angry with me because I failed them in some way. I would feel guilty and ashamed of myself for letting them down, and it was probably my fault for putting myself in this situation. Their anger is likely justified. I probably shouldn't match them in anger but instead try to conciliate. ","I received the award through hard work and a lot of time spent preparing for whatever contest it was for. 
I was able to achieve it through a lot of effort and time. It wasn't that I was intrinsically better than the people around me. 
I feel proud of myself and humbled that I was given the opportunity to compete. "
50119,"I'm fairly spiritual and also Buddhist so I would probably think that this was their spirit or soul visiting before leaving this world or dimension. My family has a history of having experiences communicating with deceased loved ones and maintaining relationships with deceased loved ones as well as having unexpected encounters with them. The human brain is essentially a sensor and perceives *only* what it is able to sense as the only reality, so there is a possibility that there's another dimension/world/whatever you want to call it that we are simply unable to sense, though some individuals are able to tune into it. I sound like a crazy person to most people.","I would probably hang around them more and see what the common or uncommon experiences are and where they stem from. Often, the feeling of knowing someone for a long time simply comes from shared life experiences that make one very comfortable with another person. However, I do believe that some souls reincarnate. The frequency of it and the likelihood of one remembering a previous life, however, is very low.",They are angry with me because they misunderstood what I said by projecting their own emotions onto it. I don't really care because the projection of their emotions onto fact is not my problem and something they need to figure out themselves. I'm annoyed about the situation because I thought more highly of them and I'm annoyed that they were too emotional and took things too personally to be objective and actually think about what was being said.,"I received a scholarship for research or some other academic merit. I was able to achieve this because of guidance from mentors, opportunities that opened up, and people who believed in me, mentored me, and simply gave me a chance. I feel proud about getting it, shocked because I have not been doing well enough for any kind of financial academic recognition lately, and thankful to those who have helped me achieve what I have. I also feel more confident about my future plans and think of the reward as affirmation and confirmation that I am doing well and headed in the right direction."
97837,I think that if my grandfather told me that he loved me right before he passed and I woke up I would be very sad and confused. I would be sad because he is gone and I will never see him again.

33691,"I think this happens because there is more than just our physical bodies. As a Christian, I do believe in life after death and that there is more to our consciousness than just our brains. I believe this is possible, although uncommon. The connections we make and the relationships we have with people matter more than just right now.","I think that happened because people who have had similar experiences are shaped in a similar manner. Some things that people have done, seen, or experienced can have effects on how who person is and becomes. Even if it feels like we've known each other for decades, we have not. However, it is possible that we were meant to meet each other.","My friend is angry with me. He gets mad at me sometimes over dumb things, like when I told him it bothered me when he no-showed to our plans to work out. I'm frustrated with the situation and try to talk it out. He probably tries to avoid it, so I let him explain why he's mad and just get past it. With some time, we won't be mad anymore, and things will be fine.","I received the award for something academic. I was able to achieve the grades or good academic habits by studying and taking school seriously, especially like my junior year of high school. I'm super excited to get the award because I appreciate when hard work is recognized. I look around to my friends and family who were around when it was really tough or when I was really stressed or who helped me have fun during those times."
90693,"I think dreams are unconscious manifestations relating to everyday concerns or cues that may have primed us during the day. It is likely that I thought about my loved one, or have some ongoing unconscious concern, affection and respect for them. That would have triggered the dream. So them dying would be a probabilistic coincidence, but makes me sad regardless.","It is likely that we share many common interests and are in sync with each other that makes me feel that sense of camaraderie. Our personalities, communication type and conversational style are probably similar. We can build off each other's energies. Or, the person may remind me of an old friend. ",They are angry at me because I did something wrong. I might have said or done something insensitive or hurtful to them. I feel bad and upset at myself. I feel determined to not do the same mistake again.,"I received the award for having done something commendable or helpful to others. I was able to achieve it because I worked hard, was responsible and knew how to set goals. It is possible that the award was given to many other people around me too. I would feel proud for receiving an achievement, but may question to what extent it reflects my character or worth."
44692,"This happens because I did not value what I had enough. Whether it's a person, friendship, or privelage, I did not realize the importance of what I had and the rest of my life would be less meaningful if I didn't acknowledge that. Even though it was right in front of my eyes the whole time, I always worried about something I did not have.","Our perceptions of the world would have been similar based on the ways we were brought up. Consequently, our sense of humor, interests, and hobbies would also be similar, and there would be endless things to talk about. We also might have felt that we were alone or had a gap in our life, so we may turn this one connection into something deeper because we found it.","They are angry because it doesn't seem like I put in the effort to reinforce our friendship or show my love for them. I feel that they are right to be mad, because I often struggle with my priorities even though I have immense love for my friends and family. I just can't always keep my promise of putting them before myself or education.","The award is for a creative idea that I turned into a successful business. I achieved it through understanding that hard work and taking risks is the only way to find out what we are capable of, and I wanted to experience that in my lifetime. I feel proud and satisfied that I got a deeper understanding of my abilities and what I am able to achieve."
56658,"I think this happens randomly. I don't think dreams can predict real-world events. Maybe my brain knows what the loved one's personality is like so it fabricates a story about their wisdom and puts it in my dream. I think this dream has no connection to them dying the next day. However, I might feel comforted that I got to hear from them one last time, even if it was fake.","This usually happens to me when someone and I have the same viewpoint on life. For example, I feel like I've know people for a long time when we both hate wasting time and are always looking for ways to be more efficient. This also happens when the person and I are both friendly, introverted, and generally optimistic (within reason). Finally, I also feel connected to people who have the same viewpoint as me in that they tend to take things as they are instead of complaining or talking about the ways things could be better.","They are angry with me because I made a mistake, like leaving something on the stove and it burning and stinking up the house. I feel ashamed and stupid because I couldn't remember to turn off the stove and I wasn't smart enough to write myself a note to turn it off when I was done. I also feel like I need to do something to earn them back. For instance, maybe I will do extra chores, be more considerate than usual, or give them lots of compliments in the next week. ","I received an award for being the most dedicated student in a certain class, maybe physics. I achieved this award by earning high grades, going to office hours whenever they were offered, helping classmates with their questions, and waking up for my 8:00 am physics class every day. I feel satisfied that I was dedicated enough for my dedication to be recognized by someone else. I also feel proud that I will be able to show the award to my family so they know they did a good job by sending me to college."
50327,"If I had a dream like this, I would probably think that I really missed them, or had some sort of sinking feeling that they were going to die soon. I don't totally believe that who I was talking to in the dream was their spirit, I believe more in that the dream was created by my subconscious because I could sense something was off. When my mom died a couple years ago, it came suddenly, but I could start sensing that things were a bit ""off"" leading up to when she died. The dream probably came from that kind of feeling that their death is unavoidable. ","I probably would have met this person before in elementary school, or had been someone I knew from out of town from a vacation that I hadn't seen for a while and eventually forgot about them. I also usually have a harder time recognizing people I haven't seen in a while, so they could have even been from a somewhat recent time in my past. I would probably feel confused, and might ask them about where they went to school or something to try to figure out who they are. ","If someone is angry with me, it would probably be because I said something to upset them accidentally, and I may have said something in a bad way, or interpreted something wrongly. I typically am pretty non confrontational, because I don't like it when people are mad with me. When someone is angry with me, I usually feel really guilty and upset, and I usually argue back. I usually feel a mix of anger and guilt when someone is angry with me, and I usually either fight back tears or cry. ","I probably received the award for something that has to do with school, or a scholarship or something along those lines. I would be able to achieve being able to receive the award by working really hard at what I do in school, or some biology-research related award. I would feel very proud, and ecstatic about receiving it. I would feel like all of the hard work that I did was worth it. "
88304,"Through some mysterious resonance over space or coincidence, or the moment that I learned about their death I made up some false memory of a dream to make myself feel better",The person is similar to someone I previously knew,They are angry with me because I didn't do my work well and caused trouble. I feel ashamed and wanted to explain but I don't have excuses.,I received the award for developing an important drug. I led and worked with a team in a pharmaceutical company or university. I feel excited and honored.
78074,"I think this happens because when we die, our souls leave our bodies to go somewhere else. Before they leave our plane of existence I think they want to make sure that everything will be okay once their gone, and by reminding us that their love still lives on even after they die, it gives us some comfort to keep going forward. My mom used to work in a hospice center and she said that sometimes people would be close to death for a long time until their loved ones had the time to come say goodbye, then they would die shortly after. I think this shows that people have some control over their souls and when they get to depart from earth. ","I think this happens because some people are genuinely our soulmates in some sense. It doesn't have to be in a romantic way, but some people are just meant to be in our lives to teach us something important. Maybe you had a connection in a past life and you were meant to meet again at a different time. I have many friends that I have met through unusual circumstances that have ended up being closer to me than people that I have known for years. You just ""click"" with some people. ","If someone is angry with me, it is probably because of something that I forgot to do or because I didn't think before I did/said something. Either that or I made them angry by calling them out on something or starting an argument. The way I feel about the situation would depend on how close I am with the person and how long I think it will be until they stop being angry at me. Like if it was my sister, I probably wouldn't care very much because I know she loves me and we will get over it soon. If I did something wrong to a stranger that I might not talk to again, I would probably be pretty upset because that would be the thing they think of when they think of me forever.",I got an award for something academic that I achieved by working hard and doing research in a field that I enjoy. Maybe it is for a psychological study or for my Masters or something. I am so excited to win this award because my work has paid off and is being recognized by my peers! I get to hug my parents and tell them that I did it all for them.
75100,"I think that is very possible that life is interconnected with the occurrences in my psyche. I think that this means that my family has a role to play in my navigation of life, and that whatever afterlife is at play has the functionality to allow them to impart that wisdom. I think that my mind is unconsciously connected with the world in ways that I will not ever be able to directly recognize - just feel. This would have happened to show me that I need guidance from a loved one, and that there is a greater interconnectedness that I never knew about.","I think that this would have happened because we feel incredibly in sync with one another. I would not rule out the possibility that fate brought us together, and that we were meant to be in each other's lives. I think that life brings you people unexpectedly, and you can become close with people that you never thought you would share a connection with. The universe brings people together for a reason - likely to help overcome the arbitrary brutality of existence.","If someone were angry with me, it would be because I am oblivious to a problem and have neglected to provide a solution. They would have been led to be angry by my inaction that is causing them to suffer. I would feel guilty and defensive at the same time because I know that their feelings ought to be recognized. I would be compelled to say that I cannot be responsible for their happiness, but deep down I would know that I am just trying to feel better about myself by putting them down.","I would have received an award for something public speaking or teaching related. I would have been able to achieve the award through intense academic and studious activity that led me to write something amazing. Getting it would give me a sense of security because I would know that I can orient myself in the world just as well, if not better, than those around me. I would be happy because I would be secure knowing that I am like other people - and they know that."
29235,"This would be a very strange coincidence. There really probably isn't any reason that this happened other than that maybe you knew before you slept that night that they were dying and those thoughts were processed in your dreams about them. Therefore, there would be no particular reason.","Sometimes, the way that someone behaves, especially if friendly and not overtly friendly can form trust quickly. Especially, if both people are willing to make new friends and open-minded then this situation would be very likely. I think that are loose groups of people that share similar mindsets and this may have manifested in the behaviors of the interaction.",They are probably angry at me for not doing something right. I must have messed up by not being careful enough. I would feel saddened by the situation of someone being mad at me.,I would be unsure what I received the reward for because I have not done anything particularly special lately. If the reward was warranted then I most likely did something either positive or showed some level of skill that deserved an award. I would feel good about the reward if it made sense to why I was receiving it.
35913,"I believe that this is a coincidence, but a happy one. That old relative was likely on my mind because I am concerned for their health at their age, so my subconscious created a version of them to see in my dreams. The life advice they told me is likely advice that I needed to hear, but couldn't process it fully while awake. I would take the advice in my dream, because it is advice that I gave to myself to help me.","First, I think that this person would have a few similar life experiences to mine that have caused us to experience some emotional and mental development a particular way. For example, we may have had a shared hardship with high school bullying that helped us grow stronger as people. I would also find it really important for the person to have a similar sense of humor as me. I always connect a lot more with people that I can laugh a lot with.Finally, we would have some similar life values and goals, and we can bond over how we want to achieve those.","I imagine someone being angry with me because I can be forgetful and irresponsible. I imagine myself not showing up to an important event I committed to earlier, or forgetting that I had to help them with a task hey cannot do alone. I would feel very guilty and understand why they are angry with me. I would be disappointed in myself, and I would try to find a way to make it up to them.","I am imagining that I just received an award for curing a disease in my future research career. I have worked very hard for this moment, and I likely spent many years in my lab focusing on this project. I feel happy knowing that all of my difficult years of studying in college have finally paid off. I would be so happy that I could make a mark on the world by helping others, and I would be extremely proud of myself."
48548,"I tend to be a fairly critical and logical person so figuring out why this might be is sort of hard. My only thought is that its the universe finding a way to give me a final goodbye or closure. I would be heartbroken if any of my grandparents were to pass, so having that final I love you and piece of wisdom would mean the world to me.","I think I would feel that way depending on their personality. If their personality meshes really well with mine or if their personality is very similar to someone I knew before, I think that I would feel like I had known them forever. if I feel comfortable or familiar around them, then it will feel like I have known them for longer.","I tend to spend a lot of time in my thoughts and as a result tune out from the world around me. This sometimes results in me forgetting to reply to texts or messages, or being hard to reach. I think that can be sort of frustrating for the people around me. I would feel bad and actively try to do better.","If I were to achieve an award, it would likely be for a scientific research contribution; however, I would hope that it would be for a scientific contribution that has a positive impact on the world around me. I would have achieved this ward by researching infectious disease through perserverance and curiosity. Even though I would be receiving the award, I would know that it was not purely of my own achievements. Science is a fairly collaborative field, and i would of had many peers and mentors to help me towards the award. "
66044,"I think there is a lot to be said about spirituality. Even though I am not religious, I believe we are all connected in spirit and this event is entirely possible. I would think that this happened because if they knew they were going to die, they would have wished to impart this wisdom on me.",I have experienced this several times with people and when I do it feels like our energies were made for each other. I think meeting someone on the same wavelength as you and who gives off the same vibes makes it feel like an age old connection almost instantly. One of my closest friends and I had this experience when meeting each other a few years ago where we hit it off immediately and could have deep conversations that most would only consider having with life long friends. I think it has to do a lot with personal values and connection to your spirituality and others around you.,"I imagine this person is angry with me because I had said something about them behind their back. I do not do this often unless I feel really comfortable with the person I am disclosing this information to, but if they had gone on to tell the person I was talking about what I had said I could see that leading to someone being angry. I would feel horrible about it, because i never feel good talking about someone behind their back, but when I do it is usually out of necessity because I feel I could not talk to the person outright without ruining our relationship. ","One of my biggest dreams is to win the nobel prize in chemistry so I am going to pretend that is the award I have just one. I would have won it after several years of daily research and a constant fascination with one topic. It would require an unimaginable amount of work to get there, but I would have given my all every day to do it. I would feel like everything I had lived for had come to be, I would feel like i would have a completely fulfilled life. "
33874,"I think that sometimes people have certain feelings or inclinations about life and things that might happen next. I don't think that there's any particular reason why, maybe some other being gives us this feeling so that we get the chance to say goodbye and make sure certain people know how we feel about them. Obviously, not everyone gets this opportunity to say goodbye or speak to their loved one before they pass away, but I think that it happens sometimes because of an odd feeling that they get, either from just a sixth sense or from a Godly being. ","I don't have any inclinations for any particular religion or belief but I like to think that some type of reincarnation is possible. The idea of your spirit or essence being reincarnated after you pass away is a really relieving thought to have. I think it's even possible for just a part of your spirit or essence to be continued elsewhere. I'm not sure why this happens, maybe because some parts of people are so unique and beautiful, the universe can't possible part with it and somehow that essence is continued in another being. ",Someone is angry with me because I wasn't 100% listening to them and they're frustrated with me and I'm frustrated with them. Perhaps we're having a serious conversation and I'm not listening to them fully and they're frustrated over the fact that I'm not understanding what they're trying to tell me because I'm not listening fully. I'm upset at the situation because I'm frustrated because they're upset with me and I want to try and solve the problem by hearing them out and engaging with them fully. ,"I received an award for an amazing scientific discovery that has changed the world. (I'm in an environmental science class right now, so my mind immediately jumps to some scientific discovery to help the environmental crisis). I worked tirelessly for years and years with an amazing team to receive this award. There are a lot of ups and downs and many obstacles that we had to jump through to accomplish this goal. I feel accomplished and proud of my self and the team that I had to work with to get there. Most of all I feel grateful for the opportunities that I was able to experience to get me to that point and for the people that were there for me during all of it. "
94972,"I think the most likely explanation for this is that it's a coincidence. I would like to think that there's a larger connection at play or a deeper meaning, but I can't fully wrap my mind around what that would be. I feel like I have heard stories like this from people who have lost a loved one and were extremely convinced that their loved one's spirit was with them in some way. While I enjoy hearing these stories and hope that I might have a similar meaningful experience one day, I still always land on the idea that it must be a coincidence or a ""false memory"" that the person created unknowingly.","I think the other person and I likely share a lot of common interests, hobbies, personality traits, etc. So while we have not actually known each other for decades or anywhere close to that, it feels like we have because of our similarities. I do not believe that it's possible we knew each other in a previous life or anything along those lines. ","They are angry with me for being too picky and anal about meaningless things in my life. I struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder and as a result I can't relax or even function when things are not exactly as my brain wants them to be. This applies primarily to my home life, where I insist that every single item is perfectly in its place and free of dust (among other habits). This is often frustrating for people I interact with because they feel like they're walking on eggshells when I'm constantly obsessing over things being perfect. I also sometimes lash out at people if they're not meeting my OCD expectations. I feel self-conscious about this and I understand why they'd be angry about it, but I also recognize that I can't help it and it's something that I'm working on but will take a lot of time.","I received the award for academic performance (likely in a chemistry class). I always have been an over-achiever, which is both one of my biggest strengths and simultaneously one of my biggest weaknesses (because of the toll it takes on my mental health). I was able to earn the award purely by working hard and putting in the hours to study/practice material. I feel very validated and proud of myself upon receiving it."
53878,"This happened because that person had to tell me something before they left. It was a sign that they were present in my dream. Some type of outside force allowed this to happen, or it might have just been simple coincidence. I would not be able to pinpoint exactly why it happened but would be happy that I had that moment with them. ",This happens when people have personalities that work with each other. We might have been destined to meet each other. Or perhaps we met each other in another life. It is also possible that we just match each other's energies and are compatible. ,"They are angry at me because I said something mean to them that I shouldn't have said. I called them something as a joke, but they got offended. I feel guilty about the situation and wish I could take back my words. ",I received an award for my scientific research. I worked on my research project for several months and made significant findings that have a huge impact on medicine. I feel proud of myself for receiving this award. I also feel accomplished as I have always wanted to be recognized for my work. 
48958,This situation may happen if you believe in a connectivity among people in the world or that someone has a sense of awareness of their loved ones. I would likely believe that it was a happy coincidence that I had such a perfectly timed dream and glad that I could be with them through that experience. I am unsure what I believe surrounding the afterlife and connection among individuals on a deeper level at this moment.,I think that meeting someone and feeling like you have known them forever happens when you are meant to be close to someone. Having similar personalities or same sense of humor is usually a characteristic of a relationship that forms quickly. I feel as if these situations are rare because rarely do personalities mesh in a way that makes you feel this sense of connectivity.,"If someone were angry with me, it could be related to an action that I did that was maybe thinking of just myself. Considering only myself would be harmful to others and may make them feel left out, sad, angry, confused, etc. I would feel very sad and guilty if someone were angry at me and would want to do whatever I could to fix it.","I would hope to receive a reward in some way for caring for other people. I imagine this would most likely happen within my career path as I am going into what is known as a ""helping profession."" I would feel very honored if I won an award for this because I would truly be making an impact on other people's lives. I think that it would also be gratifying to know that my hard work to get to that point in my life would have paid off."
28512,"This happened because they made sure that before they died, they said goodbye. I am not a very superstitious person but I do believe that within each person is a spirit and although our bodies may pass away, our spirits never do. Their spirit is what visited me in my dream to say goodbye and give some wisdom. I think it also shows that love transcends the physical world.","If I meet someone for the first time and share an uncanny sense that we've known each other for decades, I would feel some confusion. I am not sure how and why this happened but it certainly is an interesting coincidence. I would take it as fate and try to strike up some conversation with this person and establish a relationship. If we felt like we've known each other, then chances are that we were meant to know each other.",Someone is angry with me right now so I will just describe this situation. My best friend is angry with me for reaching out to her ex-boyfriend. I reached out to him because I was worried about her and knew that a lot of her sadness stemmed from him. I feel that it is a dumb reason to be angry with me because I had her best interests at heart and I came forward and told her instead of keeping it a secret.,"I received an award for care. I tend to gravitate towards opportunities where I get to show concern and care for others. If I were to receive an award, it would probably be for something that I am dedicated to like caring for others. While I quite like being accomplished, I do not like receiving awards because I equate awards with an unhealthy sense of pride."
56571,"I would probably be very upset at the fact that happened, and would take it very seriously. If there was a reason that this happened, it would probably be that it felt like they needed to talk to me and tell me something that I would have never been able to figure out on my own. I would be confused as to why I was the one they chose to talk to, which would make me feel bad if there was someone else that was closer to this person that did not have this dream. Honestly if I think about it like that then it seems like the dream was something that was supposed to happen, which would confuse me more.","I would have probably met this person while I was doing something that I found uncomfortable or funny and another person was too, so that I could see someone being vulnerable while I was. I think that that kind of situation would help me trust someone enough to talk to them and feel like I have known them for a long time. If they immediately start talking to me about their feelings it would make me more likely to feel comfortable around them and express my opinions too.","If someone were angry with me, it would probably be because I crossed a boundary with them, like if I said something about someone that I didn't realize was harmful to another person and they found out about it. I try really hard to prevent situations like this so it would make me very nervous. I would feel very guilty and upset, and if the situation were serious enough, I would probably feel scared about talking with that person again.","If this were in the future after I graduated and started a career in something I wanted, like chemistry or some other science, then the award would probably be some sort of scientific achievement award to celebrate something that I discovered. I would be incredibly happy with myself and would feel very content with my life and career if this were to happen. I would probably want to immediately tell my family and friends about it. I would feel a little bit sad that my mom couldn't see me getting this award, but it would help me appreciate spending time with the rest of my family and friends celebrating."
55214,"I guess that might happen if the loved one felt there was something important we were never able to discuss, or if they felt they needed to speak to me to help me understand and cope with the loss better. I do have people close enough to me that if they were to die suddenly, I don't know that I could recover from such a loss. ","I would probably feel this way if the person related to lots of specific interests of mine, or observed something about me that I felt only someone very close to me would pick up on. I tend to feel that it takes time and experience for people to get to know me, so if a person could note a specific trait of mine, it would make me feel like we knew each other well. In terms of interests, if we shared lots of prior experiences, likes/dislikes that take time and experience to draw out.","Ugh my boss is angry that I don't have research results or I am not completing tasks quick enough or well enough. My boss has been pretty disappointed with my research performance since I began this job, as I've never been able to get an experiment to reflect the expected results well. I'm really disappointed in myself for this too, especially since becoming lab manager and feeling like my research has taken a back seat to the needs of my co-workers and administrative work. ","I imagine I've achieved ""Lab Manager of the Month"" recognition or something like that. My coworkers would have nominated me for it. I achieved it by being a reliable, helpful, and pleasant lab manager to my cor-workers. My boss also acknowledges what a big help I am!"
24883,"This has actually happened, though not in the exact way described, to several people in my family. I'm not superstitious in the traditional American sense (black cats are lovely, mirrors break sometimes, it doesn't meant anything), but I do believe that... even if we don't have a traditional 'spirit', there's something beyond just our brainwaves. The world is too strange to just be what we perceive. So people visiting loved ones before they die, or when they're dying, as a way of saying goodbye - I'll believe it.","I don't think this has ever happened to me. I'm pretty good at playing at confidence in social interactions, so I can act familiar when I'm really not being. But I don't go around spilling inner thoughts until I've known someone for several months or even longer, and even then its conditional. I can't imagine meeting someone and sharing that instant ""love at first sight"" -like sense... at most just feeling that someone has a good vibe? Maybe it's just their vibes that are like mine.","I guess my responses to this would differ based on if this is a strong tie or a weak tie. If its a weak tie I'd feel bad, but I probably wouldn't notice they're angry at me unless they say it. Strong ties are easier to notice; my mom is constantly angry at me if I don't act in an 'appropriate' way or say things which are not conductive to acting in an appropriate way. Usually I feel annoyed because when  I say things in private, its not because I mean to act on them, I just want an outlet for irritation. 

In short, unless someone tells me they're angry, I won't know why they're angry, and will probably feel a bit awkward but not care too much unless I'm really in the wrong.","I would love to receive an award for something I've created, especially if its something that goes on to live in posterity. I just love making something new and being praised about it (shameless, but true). I think an award doesn't really mean that much in the grand scheme of things, but its still a nice recognition - a little sign that says, hey, we really liked this! It's been a long time since I won anything so it would feel nice."
64326,"I think people we are close to are connected with us on some spiritual level, so sometimes we can tell if something happens to them before actually knowing. I would incredibly saddened if this happened to be, but also grateful to know that we had such a close connection. That dream would forever be considered one of my last memories of / with them.","I would feel like I am in a movie because even though that sense would be amazing, I would immediately become suspicious and proceed with caution. I like to think that people are good, but this is not always the case so when something seems too good to be true, I carefully access the other person and monitor my own words and actions.",Someone would be angry with me for going out of my way to do something. People who are close to me always warn me of this. It makes me re-assess my thinking but ultimately proceeding with more caution in the future. I would continue to do the same actions but with heightened awareness.,I believe I would win an award for being a caring person. I always try to help people in any way that I can and have done so purely based on internal drive. I would feel happy yet awkward receiving a reward for doing something a lot of people do on a daily basis. 
28441,"I think subconsciously you know that you hadn't spoken with them very often or felt as if you don't tell them you love them as much as you should. However, since this person has just passed, their spirit is still out there. Their spirit is what came to visit you and tell you that it's okay and that they still love you because they know they didn't say it that often either. They want you to know that will always care for you though. ","I think this kind of ties into the ideas of soulmates. You can either have a romantic soulmate, a platonic soulmate, or maybe even just someone that's supposed to come into your life for a reason. In another lifetime, you and this other person has promised each other that you will come back and find each other again and you have, but of course it's a new lifetime so you won't actually ever know. You've been given the chance to keep making bonds with this person over and over because you just match. ","If someone was angry at me, I feel like it would be because I didn't word something right way. I also think I might've upset their feelings by being passive aggressive or something of the sorts because sometimes I don't realize that I am being that. I don't think it would have been something I did but rather something I said because I can be emotional when talking sometimes and maybe say something I don't mean. If someone is angry with me, then I would hate being in that situation and feel angry with myself as well. ","I would like to think if I just received an award, it would be for gymnastics or cheerleading. I have a meet coming up and I'm also currently deciding whether or not to join club cheer which has a nationals. Either way, hard work and determination has brought me the award because of how hard I have worked in either sport. I would feel amazing for getting it and accomplished as well. "
97263,"I think this happens because when life comes to a close people do not want to have regrets and want to be remembered in a positive way. There is also a short amount of time left for them to say what they haven't yet to a loved one. Moreover, someone is most likely to carry that advice along with them when it is the last memory of someone important to them. ","I think this would happen because a sense of familiarity, whether it be physical appearances or simply a personality trait. We often attach to what we feel most comfortable with and when someone may have that specific thing, it can create a false connection. Lack of remembrance of a different, but supposedly similar, person may also cause this mistake.","They are angry at me because of something I said to offend them. A remark I made was taken personally and that led them to be angry with me. This makes me feel incredibly guilty because I did not intentionally say something to hurt their feelings, oftentimes it has nothing to do with them. Until, they mention their feelings being hurt I have no idea that they took it personally.",I received the award for class participation and leadership. I was able to achieve this award by being attentive and actively involved in the classroom setting individually and in groups. I am proud and ecstatic about being recognized for the award.
20932,"I think there are certain things that your brain processes faster than you do and some truths that you subconsiously know in your heart. I am not religious at all but I am slightly spiritual and while I almost always need evidence to believe things, things like this I can accept without a logical reasoning. ",Maybe I know someone who they remind me of. Their mannerism and characterists could be exactly like a close friend of mine's. Or maybe this person and I are similar in unexplicable ways and that is something that we both subconsiously catch onto.,They are angry with me because I messed up and didn't consider all the factors in a particular situation. I was caught up in my plans in the moment and didn't think of what they're really going through. I feel really bad and can't believe that I didn't react in a more empathetic manner because this feels unlike me,I received an Olympic award for long jump. i was able to achieve it thanks to my coach and the time that I spent practicing. I feel great about getting it and it feels like my hard work has finally paid off.
26204,"I would think that this would happen through some strange and very complicated machinations of the universe. I think that this experience could be explained by psychology, although I wouldn't discount the idea of a supernatural force either. In terms of psychology, I would think that I would be more likely to dream about a person if I knew they were in poor health, and would therefore be more likely to have a dream about someone who was about to die.","I would think that this probably occurs because we grew up in similar households and/or situations. This similar experience could result in making us two very similar people, or it could just mean that we saw each other in people we were surrounded by growing up. For example, maybe this other person doesn't remind me of myself very much, but they remind me of my best friend from childhood. ","Someone is angry at me either because I either showed up late, forgot to do something, or neglected to do something. They are angry because they think that I am disrespecting them and do not value their time. I feel upset at myself for messing up, and probably a little angry at them too because I want to deflect some of the negative emotions I am feeling about myself onto them. However, I probably realize that this anger towards them is irrational and try not to act on it. ","I have received an award for being an exceptional student in some aspect. I was able to achieve the award by being hard-working and a little obsessive about something. I feel proud and happy for getting it, although I also probably feel a little embarrassed about. I am probably excited to put the award on my resume."
78541,"I would probably think that they somehow communicated to me through the dream. I'm Catholic so I'm not entirely sure what the Church says about this, but I sort of think that it could be a way that they might be communicating their love to me while they are in the afterlife. Or maybe it was because I was thinking of them and had some knowledge that something was wrong with them. ","I think if this were to happen, it would be more likely to happen in a situation where I don't know anyone else too. For example, I feel like I am often more open to people that I don't know anything about compared to people who I might have mutual friends with or might be acquaintances with. I guess it is because I am less likely to have preconceived notions about the person and am less likely to believe that they have preconceived notions about me, so I am more open to talking vulnerably and deeply to this person, allowing us to discover that we feel like we have known each other for decades.","Someone is probably angry with me because I left things unsaid or didn't communicate well. I think that is something I really don't like about myself and struggle with, and I know other people in my life have felt frustrated with me about that too. I have trouble having hard/vulnerable conversations with people, and sometimes just push away instead of having them, which makes the situation even worse.","I probably received either an academic or an athletic award, since those are the two main things that I've gotten awards for in the past. I probably spent a lot of hours of hard work working on whatever I got the award for, and worked with the specific goal in mind of achieving that award. I get a lot of satisfaction through achievement/success, so I'm sure I would be really happy and feel a sense of pride."
48848,"I think that this shows that everyone soul's are connected -- especially the ones that you are closest to. I am not sure how this happens. However, I think everyone is in your life for a reason, and you are in other's lives for a reason. So it happens because they were here to teach you something and maybe the last lesson happens in a dream. ",I think that this just means your souls are connected in a way that maybe you have encountered each other in the past in a different way. I think this happens because everyone in your life is there for a reason. I am also not sure how this happens. ,"Someone is angry with me because I let them down or had to cancel a plan. I tend to do too many things at once and cannot fit everything into my schedule that I think I can. I am trying to work on balance and saying no. It makes me feel extremely upset because I am trying to do everything and be there for everyone, but there is not enough time. ",I received an award for changing the way that hospitals function -- focusing more on holistic care and the mind/body connection in regards to healing. This is opposed to the current biomedical system which solely focuses on the physical aspect of wellness. I was able to achieve this through working in healthcare consulting to implement these changes into hospitals. I would feel really proud of myself and hopeful for the populations overall wellness in the future. 
75835,"As I said with a previous question, I can't really say for sure why or how this happens. I, personally, thinks this has to do with the spiritual world. Maybe the loved one passed away and wanted to tell me goodbye before they left. Or maybe it was something in my subconscious that led me to have this dream.","If I felt like this around someone I just met, I would start to think that this was either someone I just had a lot in common with or that we actually did know each other before, potentially in a past life. I'm not sure if either these thoughts are correct, but I do find it incredibly interesting when I meet somebody that I feel like i have known forever. I can't say for sure why this might happen either, but my thoughts are that I was meant to meet/see this person again. Maybe they were a soul tie, but for whatever reason I was supposed to meet this person again.","I'm going to use a situation that is similar to what I've been experiencing lately. I likely have someone angry with me because I have a position of ""power"" and they don't, or I'm not doing what they would like me to do. The person either wants to have the power that I have in my leadership position or they think that they would do something different than what I'm doing. This makes me feel upset, for I'm doing my best to do my best for the given organization. ","I would image that I received the award for something related to leadership. I've held quite a few leadership positions throughout college, so it seems as if this would be appropriate. I was able to achieve great leadership skills (which I'm assuming I got the award for) by listening to others criticism, talking to my mentor, and always trying to help others. I feel extremely happy about getting this award. I have put so much energy and effort into one organization, so it would be an honor to receive an award for it."
63965,"I am not sure how this happens, but I would imagine there is some measure of coincidence with this. I cannot think of how this information would be 'transmitted' to another person (so to speak). I think it's likely that we could have had similar dreams at other times but just forgot about them. Because of learning the news about the death, the dream may have seemed more salient / easy to remember the next day. ","People can be really similar, and some characteristics can be more salient than others. If I feel this way, it is likely because I knew someone with physical or social characteristics that were very similar to the other person. It could also just be that the person feels very warm and inviting, and that gives you the sense of being familiar with them, even if that isn't literally the case.","I'm not sure why they would be angry with me in this scenario. If the intent is to think of reasons why someone is usually angry with me, I would say it is because I can be a little overly timid and/or nervous in some situations, and it can be annoying for others. I would probably feel a little nervous about the other person being angry with me, but it would probably depend on the specific situation. Without a more specific scenario, I'm not sure I could really expect how I would feel other than a little nervous/apprehensive.","I'm not sure what I received the award for, but knowing my current situation, it would probably be for my current academics or teaching assistant positions. I would be able to achieve an award like this through dedication and a lot of hard work. I would probably feel proud about getting the award, but I think this would only be the case if I felt like the level of effort I put in matched what was expected with the award. I'm not sure how I would feel about getting the award if I didn't feel like the level of effort for those two things really aligned."
10965,"I think our souls/consciousness can sometimes be linked to other people's. I am not sure how this happens, but something similar has happened to me before where I dreamed about someone or something and then appeared in my life. I think these synchronicity-like events are the universe's way of guiding/helping us.",I have definitely experienced this feeling when meeting new people before. I think in some way we are connected through the past. I am not sure how exactly this works--maybe past lives or experiences like two neighboring trees in a forest connect us to other people throughout time.,"They are angry with me for prioritizing my school and work over the rest of my life. I try to keep things balanced, but from time to time I slip. When this happens, I can get really stressed out and anxious and that can effect the space between me and the other people in my life. ",I just received an award for my chemistry research. I was able to accomplish this through my years of hard work and dedication in school and in my lab. I am very excited to get an award and see a tangible result of all of my work. I hope to continue this work and receive more awards in the future.
13624,"As a man of faith in Jesus, I think it happened intentionally. I firmly believe that God can speak to us through dreams, which often need interpreting. This dream could have been a way for God to prepare me for that loved one's death. I feel as if I would be much more comforted and at peace with the death if I had this dream, as I would have believed that it was given to me by God and it's all according to His plan.","I think this happened because we most likely shared common life experiences. They may have brought up a topic that I feel very passionately about and that I've talked about for years. It may also have been a common hobby or pastime brought up that we both enjoy. Regardless, the feeling of familiarity came from an understanding of each other only based on the knowledge of shared life experiences.","Someone is angry with me because I called them out on not doing their fair share of dishes. They used many plates, bowls, cups, and utensils, and didn't have the courtesy to clean them off and put them in the dish washer. So, I gave them a reminder, which may not be the friendliest, and they would get defensive and attempt to justify their laziness. I don't feel great about the situation, especially since it was over such a relatively small thing like dishes, which I could have easily done myself.","I received the award for being a great small group leader in my campus ministry. The award is given to small group leaders who exhibit a sacrificial love for their members. I was able to achieve this by setting aside time to spend with members individually, even if that means I won't finish an assignment when I wanted to or I don't get to eat a meal. I feel great about getting the award, but it's definitely not the reason for why I do what I do."
73177,"I think that in some way or another, when someone passes away, the lessons/wisdom/love/interests/whimsy/humor are carried out of their physical being. That we can feel that lost person's soul in all the conversations we had with them and all the belongings they collected in their lifetime. I believe that we can still keep learning from someone even after we lose them. When I dreamed that my far-away loved one visits my dream, I believe that they are spreading the love and wisdom they have for me beyond a physical realm, where I can still learn from them even after they are gone.","This has happened to me before. Where someone's emotional vulnerability and their aura seem to be indescribably familiar. I tend to mistake a person who has the same interests or philosophies on life as me as someone who I feel that I have met before. The sense of familiarity that they share with me, makes me mistake their company for someone I have already met. In reality, it is just the traits/hobbies/interests that mirror myself that I recognize.","They are angry with me for not truthfully communicating my feelings. This has happened to me in the past, in multiple situations, where I try to appease a situation and I end up making it worse. The other person is angry because I will not open up to them and I end up pushing them away. In this situation, I feel sad because in my attempt to do something I thought was good and avoiding a difficult conversation, I made the situation worse and upset the other person. I feel guilty and angry with myself for making the other person mad.","I received an award for compassion. I was able to achieve this by an anonymous nomination that nominated me for the award for someone who displays compassion. It took me a long time to think of what award I would win because I do not see myself having any outstanding achievements or notable qualities, but I would like to think that someone would experience the kindness I try to consistently extend and nominate me for the hypothetical award. In this scenario, I am overwhelmingly happy that someone has noticed me to be a compassionate person, as that is my goal."
94204,I think this is probably going to happen. One reason is that I miss the loved one too much. I keep thinking about he/she so he/she appears in my dream. Their life wisdom may be something that they always tell me about but I fail to listen to.,"it is possible that the person has many similarities with someone that I am very close with. For example, he/she may have a similar tone with one of my friend, or looks like one of my friend. Another possibility is that is person talks like he/she understand me well. If he/she surprises me that they know about me more than I expect, I may feel that we have known each other for many years.","I think they are angry with me because I am not taking my responsibility of my work. This can happen if the work I am doing is not interesting to me. In this case, I tend to be very lazy. I would feel embarrassed and keep finding excuses. ","I received an award because I helped saving lives of many cats and dogs. I achieved such things because of the support of my team and my family members, and my hard work. I would see it as a motivation that drives me to keep doing good deeds and help more. "
94842,"I feel this is spiritual. When a person dies their spirit leaves their body. I am not quite sure why they would visit loved ones. Though, I know this is a frequent occurance.","This would happen because we automatically remember of someone who is just like that person. I feel we instantly identify attributes that remind us of a person who we knew before. There isn't an exact reason why this happens, it just does. ",If someone is angry with me it is most likely because I acted distant or passive aggressive. If there's a quarrel or a negative situation usually I would withdraw and because of that might lead them to be passive aggressive. It would make me regret the situation and how I handled it.,"I received an award for my academic success. I was able to achieve the award through hard work and diligence. I feel successful after receiving an award like that. In a way, I feel validated."
95113,"I think this happens because they may also be thinking of me at that moment. I think we are connected to the people we love and I often find myself strangely in sync with loved ones. Perhaps, subconsciously, I had sensed their death and that caused me to think of them in the moment they visit me in the dream. In that case, I think my brain would be acting more so to give myself peace of mind and reassurance that the person loved me.","This is one of my favorite sensations; when I ,meet someone new and I can already feel how strong our connection is. I think this is because people with shared personality types or personal experiences each have specific cadences only recognizable by others who know exactly how they've felt. For example, whenever I am around other people of color I feel strongly connected to them no matter what because we share our minority. This feeling is similar to that felt.with people I feel I have known for decades. I think the reason this occurs is simply a green light saying it's okay to be yourself and enjoy their company.","Most of the time when people are angry with me, it is because of my lack of communication. For example, I often pull away in stressful situations and block out the person I love. This usually leads to them being angry although, those who really know/love me most do not approach situations like this with anger. My feelings in response to this is always bad; I am unaware when I am doing it so once someone expresses anger I feel very apologetic, guilty, and overall depressed.","I just received an academic award for most improved. I think this would feel immensely fulfilling because I always feel like I am putting a lot of work into my studies. I achieved it through long hours studying, spending time going over notes, and reading the textbooks. Additionally, I have a solid support group who really pushes me forward. I would feel super proud of myself; this would save me and make me feel like everything is worth it."
13663,"I am not the most confident in what I believe in regards to religion or what happens after one dies, but I do feel like there is something bigger beyond our reality, so I think if this were to happen, something bigger and more spiritual would have played a roll. I also feel that loved ones always play a constant roll in imparting wisdom, love, and advice, so this could explain why a dream like that could have happened as well. ","If I meet someone for the first time and share an uncanny sense that we've known each other for decades, I feel that this may have happened if we were to experience a deep and meaningful interaction within the first minutes of knowing each other. If we were to have figured out that we share many common ideas or experiences, I feel this would prompt the feeling of knowing them for decades. ","Someone is angry with me because it is hard for me to prioritize things in my life, whether it be friends, school, family, etc. They are angry with me because of this because I've spent too much time not having my priorities in line that I have neglected one, or many aspects of my life to nurture another. I can understand this situation and I am also angry at myself because of this ","I received the award for being giving to others I love. I was able to achieve what brought me to the award because I really care about the way others perceive me and the way I impact the lives of others, so I always treat others the best I can. I feel good about getting this award because it means others have recognized my efforts to care for those around me."
96553,"If I were visited by a loved one in a dream this way shortly before their death I think it would probably change the way I think about the world a lot. I personally don't believe anything happens for a reason, so I would probably believe that it happened due to coincidence. However, this is a very difficult thing to purely attribute to coincidence because I generally do not have dreams with my family members in them. Perhaps, something like this could happen if their was reasonable belief that they may die.","I think that sometimes people just have personalities and interests that align particularly well. This makes conversations seem natural, or like you have met the person before. Other times, one or both people is especially warm and inviting, which also makes connection come more naturally. There is no predestined reason for meeting other people, but sometimes probability leads to strong, instant connection.","I think the times people become most angry with are when I hold to strongly to certain beliefs, and I come off as stubborn an unyielding. It is possible that I chose to do a specific thing, such as work, rather than do something that the other person wanted, which upset them. I am often overwhelmed in situations like this because I can only do what I believe is right and there is only so much time to fill with all of the things you care about. Thinking about this situation is making me stressed.","I won an award for leadership within my profession. I won this award because I am kind and empathetic to my peers while also being effective at getting things done. I often receive praise from my peers in group work for being understanding and also good at my job. I feel a bit embarrassed by the award because despite recognizing these qualities in myself, I am uncomfortable with praise."
21424,I haven't got the slightest of clues and certainly do not think that I am qualified to speak on what researchers have spent decades trying to determine themselves and have been unsuccessful doing so. The unconscious mind is a wild place - as someone who dreams often (sometimes pleasant and sometimes not) I would like to say dreams are the spaces our minds live out our emotions in a nonsensical way from that day whether we were aware of those emotions or not. As far as loved-ones coming to you I am sincerely not sure - perhaps it is something outside of understanding into the spiritual realm of creation. Connections the brain doesn't necessarily process but rather the soul. The brain is just a window into that space,"I think people are fundamentally all human and connect in some fashion, especially if you are looking for it. While I don't think everyone spirit vibes with each other per say, I do think that sometimes there are connections because we can see in others what we aspire to have or attain ourselves. I think it is also easy to find things you love in people if they are similar to you and create this feeling that you've known each other. Of course you have, you've known yourself and are looking in a mirror essentially ","I am unsure why they are angry with me, likely because I assumed something incorrectly or misspoke. I likely said something in a way that didn't come out correctly in tone or using the right phrasing and didn't pause to think before I did or said. I very much dislike when people are angry at me because I feel sad and like I have let someone down. It makes me angry at myself that I couldn't have mitigated the situation. ","At this stage in life the only realistic award I could get would likely be on merit and contribution to the Physical Therapy Community. But that's utterly boring so we will say I get it for something fun in an activity I'm doing like running a race, competing in escape rooms, etc. I would achieve it through hard work and dedication in the area or field of training paired with innovation and creativity. I like getting awards because they make others proud and happy for me, but I honestly don't particularly like being center of attention so I'm impartial if I get an award or not. "
52699,"I think when we know that people we love are in danger or people that we have a close connection to, we are able to create scenarios such as the one above to justify what is happening to them. A lot of my friends think they may have a fifth sense when it comes to sensing that someone they love is in danger so that may also be a reason for such occurrences. I think when we're deeply connected to people we are able to relate and maybe predict what is going to happen in their lives or we are so connected that we can also have the sense they are in trouble and then our brain tries to justify this. As for a grandparent dying, I think this is the brains way of you being able to get your goodbye done so you don't feel as guilty when you learn of them passing.",You have a shared experience and feel that you can relate to them on multiple levels. Having traits in common with someone helps us connect and bond with strangers. I think this happens due to how we process our connections with others and how if we actively listen to each other and find similarities among ourselves. Mainly being open and honest while having a shared experience with someone probably is what causes this to occur.,"They are angry at me for ignoring them or for not being able to hang out with them. When I get busy or overwhelmed with life I have the tendency to cut out my social life and instead focus on finishing my work. But, the people who are upset with me don't know this pattern instead think of me as ignoring them and not prioritizing them. This in turn makes me feel awful as I should focus on them as well as work and try to find a healthy balance between the two.",I received the award for being the best speed walker to campus when I am late to class. I was able to achieve this through daily walks on campus and around my hometown and also walking on the treadmill. I was able to achieve this through hard work and determination and wearing the right shoes when choosing to walk to class. I feel excited and ready to go to class another day.
36045,"I'm not really a big believer in religion or anything divine, so I'd probably think this is a crazy coincidence. More likely, I've probably been thinking about this person a lot, (if they've been sick or in an accident) which explains why they'd show up in my dream. If their death was very sudden and I hadn't been thinking about them lately, I'm not sure what would've caused it. I still wouldn't be quick to say it's a result of ghosts, gods, etc.","I also don't think there's anything divine or extraordinary about this. We meet so many people in our lives that we're bound to find someone who feels familiar, or like an old friend. It's just based on the random characteristics we each possess, so statistically we'll eventually meet someone with the exact character traits to cause this sensation. I've met many people like this before, but I really doubt it's because I actually knew them in a past life or something.  ","Having someone be angry at me is one of my worst nightmares, so I spend a lot of time trying to avoid people being mad at me. If anything, the one thing I do that I know annoys people is being late. I'm late to a lot of stuff, always on accident, but no matter what I do, I can't seem to help it. I'd imagine they're mad at me for being late to social events with them on multiple occasions. ","I've only really ever won awards for academics, so I guess that's what my imaginary award would be for. I'd probably achieve this through studying or working hard, or maybe just through being good at a certain subject. I would feel really good about getting this award, because academic validation is one of my biggest motivations. I always end up working harder when there's a ""prize"" or award at the end of the road. "
88285,"I would definitely see this as a divine moment and a blessing from God. I believe that in their transition to the afterlife, they visited me in my sleep. This sort of interaction would gift me with peace and comfort because I would soon have to grapple with mourning the loss. I think God would recognize my need for that interaction if he sent it to me in that way; that somehow that dream and that last ""I love you"" would make a remarkable difference in the way that I move forward in life.","I think that if a person's energy matches that of someone you have known for a long time, it can reflect that feeling onto the new person. I also think that if that person really matches your own perception of yourself then there is a sense of comfort, familiarity, and mutual understanding. I think this can also be affected by the nature of the meeting; a deeper, more emotionally charged meeting may increase comfort in the interaction and result in the familiar feelings. As to how this happens, I believe that some friends are just divinely sent into our lives, and so an interaction of this nature may not be a mistake at all.  ","The person is angry with me because they misunderstood my intentions in an interaction we had. I did some sort of action that in my mind was showing respect for the person or simply living my life in the way that I do, and it was misinterpreted as having malicious intent or being exclusionary. I would feel very sad about this and partially offended for not receiving the benefit of the doubt from the person. I would be unsure about how to move forward in the relationship with the person for fear of re-occurrence of the situation.  ","I receive an award for leading behind the scenes in the production of an event. I was able to achieve what brought me the award by staying focused, organized, and communicating effectively. I was also able to achieve these things through the help of other people along the way. I feel good about getting the award, proud, but also probably undeserving and bashful. I would probably emphasize that a lot of the work was done by others, not myself."
92655,"I believe that dreams serve as a method for us to work out emotional and mental desires, and struggles that we are dealing with in our lives. So I would interpret the dream and their final message to me before they say good bye forever. They impart life wisdom as they have lived their life to its fullest capacity, and are now leaving it. So this message of theirs serves as a means for them to leave me with something, so that they can stay with me beyond their physical form.","Either I have meet their doppelganger before, they remind me of someone else I know, or I knew them in a previous life. Though i am not sure of whether or not reincarnation exists, I'd like to believe in the possibility of its existence. As believing in it explains the uncanny sense of me feeling like I've known someone I just meet for decades. But I usually chalk up my comfort around them to their mannerism reminding me of a close friend's.","They're probably angry because they feel as though something I have done or said to them has disrupted and devalued them in some way. I was upset with something else when they were talking to me, and because of that I said something to them that I would have otherwise not said. I feel guilty and ashamed because I lashed out at someone, and wasn't able to control my emotions. I don't like lashing out at people who haven't done anything to me, but are just there at the wrong time.","I received the award due to my academic achievements, as they majority of the awards I have received have been such. I was able to achieve academic success in speaking, reading, writing, and listening to Chinese, because of my handwork and dedication to the language. I feel excited and relieved because I have a physical manifestation proving that my hardwork paid off. But also satisfied as I have been recognized from my hard work and dutiful effort. "
79764,"I think this happens because it relates to a spiritual aspect of human life that I believe in. I believe that, in a way, souls are not bound to one's body and everyone in your life has a predestined relationship with you, one way or another. If this happens, I believe it is the loved-one's way of communicating that they have departed from my life and cannot tell me in person because of the physical distance between us. ",I think this feeling would happen because we would have a lot of similarities so therefore we would have a lot to talk about and therefore we would bond a lot over this. ,"A reason someone could be angry with me is because of how I am easy to be negatively influenced by situations around me. When something unfortunate happens, I oftentimes will act to the stressor and become agitated or annoyed as well and this could cause anger from others as my mood would negatively affect them as well. I feel that they are justified to be angry about how I am reacting and so I will let myself calm down first and apologize or talk it out accordingly.",I would receive the award for excellence in my field of study (Computer Science/Data Science) and significant achievements that I made within that field. I would be able to achieve this award through working hard to understand all the course material and implementing them into my life through internships and work opportunities which will subsequently lead me to learning new experiences. I would feel very proud of myself and have an increased feeling of confidence.
18458,"If I had this dream and then, the next morning, woke up to find out they had died, I would definitely think the two were related. I am not a very spiritual person, but something like that can't just be a coincidence. I would definitely feel that that person came to visit me in my dreams to say goodbye, since they didn't get the chance to in-person. An alternative explanation that I may come up with is that I had an intuition that they died and then dreamt about them because that was on my mind.","If this happened, I'd probably feel that way because we connected on several levels. I'd feel like we had similar backgrounds and like they understood my thought processes.  We may finish each others sentences or they may say something that I was thinking/ feeling but haven't been able to put into words. It could also have happened because they reminded me of someone from my childhood or one of my close friends/ family members.","If someone is angry with me it is probably because I made a mistake. Maybe I forgot their birthday or didn't call them when I said that I was going to. I feel upset about the situation, both because I messed up and because they're upset with me. Overall, I'd probably think that some anger was justified, but if it was really intense, I'd say that's an overreaction","I received an award for academic achievement at UNC. I was able to achieve good grades by really caring about learning in my classes and not just going through the motions. I'd also say that I'm passionate about the classes that I'm in, which makes it easier to learn and do well. I feel proud about receiving the award."
29417,"I would believe that this is some form of supernatural communication; the loved one themself communicating to me through the dream. I have experienced such communications, including in dreams, and I believe that they are real.","We must be very similar and feel very comfortable with each other. I've had a couple of encounters like this, and it's usually because we have similar emotions. I also think I get along very well people who also have ADHD (I have ADHD), because they are comfortable conversing in a ""scattered"" way that switches topics often. I think it's very likely that this person and I would share the same manner of speaking in this situation.",They're angry with me because I committed to something and then didn't follow through. I said I would go to an event for a period of time and I forgot about it. They're angry because they were counting on me and I didn't show up. I feel ashamed and regretful.,"I'm imagining that I received an award for writing. It might have been a poem, a novel, an academic paper, or a song. I got the award by following my passion for writing and allowing myself to take time to do it. I feel validated in that I'm being told that I'm good at something I love to do, and I feel happy."
47755,Just imagining this feels devastating (I'm tearing up just thinking about it). I'm not really sure I understand the question but if this loved one were to visit me I think it would be to tell me to be happy and find someone who makes me genuinely happy. In this imaginary dream I'm thinking of my boyfriend who has been sick the last couple of months. I know if anything were to happen to him he would ultimately want me to be happy. I think having this dream about anyone close to me and then finding out they had passed the night before would absolutely ruin me and I'd somehow blame myself for their passing. ,i think we would talk for hours and it would feel like only a few minutes would have gone by. Like something just clicked and I was supposed to meet this person (almost like a soulmate i guess). I'm not sure why situations like that happen but I'd like to presume its fate. That you are supposed to meet that person because they play some critical role in your life that can't be filled by anyone else. ,The first thing i thought of was my boyfriend or one of my roommates being mad at me. In the scenario in my head they are mad at me because I either said something mean or something I said was taken out of context. I feel really guilt about the situation because I know I'm in the wrong and even though i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings I still manage to do it. I never want to hurt anyone and its hard knowing I'm capable of that. Its even worse if I'm being honest about something that's bothering me and it ends up hurting the other person. ,In this scenario (i'm imagingin this as a future scenario) I win this award for humanitarian or non-profit work - work where I made a difference in someone else's life. I achieved this award through a lot of hard work as well as help from my colleagues. I feel like I would feel so incredibly proud of myself for getting this award and I'd probably start crying tears of joy but also exhaustion from all the work. All my friends and family are there to celebraate it with me.
63198,"I don't know whether there is the concept of a soul or not. I don't believe that once a family member passes, that they can somehow depart this world and travel into our unconsciousness. However, I do believe that we somehow create a perception of our loved ones based on our observations on their speech, actions, and behavior, and if we think about them during the day, they may subconsciously affect our dreams (i.e talking to us in our dreams). I think that, if this kind of event happened, it would be because we are thinking of our loved ones in their final days on Earth. ","I think that maybe some people just ""click"" on an emotional level, or just by looking at them, makes us feel some sort of longing or profound emotion (as for why, I can't say) that we feel like we've known this person and can deeply connect with them on some level that transcends time. I don't think I've ever had this happen to me before and I doubt the validity of this actually occurring (besides to be used to impart some sort of lovey dovey exposition in a cheesy romance novel) but if it ever does happen, I would assume that the sight of them/talking to them triggered an emotional response in our brain to make us belief so. ","They would probably be angry with me because I did something to offend them or said something that were hurtful. Usually when people are angry at me, it is because I said something that was offensive or revealing of something regarding their personal life that they didn't want me to say. Sometimes, people also get mad at me because I'm not performing optimally in either my studies or in another task. If they are angry at me because I said something wrong or under performed, I would understand where they're coming from and work to improve myself so that I wouldn't make the same mistake again. ","I just received the award for outstanding performance in my biology field, or maybe employee of the month- something about me being a hard worker. I would feel accomplished, like all my work didn't go to waste. I don't know if I'll ever receive an award for an outstanding achievement based off of ingenuity or creativity or trailblazing in any field, but I do know that I would want to receive an award commemorating my hard work and dedication to whatever I was doing. Makes me feel like there's a purpose to my actions and that they're affecting others in a positive way. "
21550,This happened because they loved Christ and were going to heaven. God allowed the dream to happen and for the loved one to speak to me. This gave me peace and deep weeping because i am thankful i got to see them one last time. ,I think i feel like i have known this person for decades because we can laugh together. We have the same sense of humor and talking is not uneasy or awkward. We are also both empathetic people who can be vulnerable. Vulnerability with trust means a lot to one another. ,"Someone is angry with me because they don't agree with me on a topic. I am bold and can speak my mind when something really bothers me or when i am asked, i will share. Society takes great offense at those that don't agree and don't love through it. I'm upset because i still gave them love when i didn't agree with their view. ",I received an award for mending friendships. This could be my own or helping others. I did this by asking God what the best route was and using wisdom. I feel happy and thankful about getting this award. 
85037,"I believe that this happens as a result of their spirit saying its goodbyes. I am a Christian, so I do believe that this would be on their spirits way to Heaven. This would seem to me as a final communication between us, and something that they would not want me to forget in the rest of my journey through life. ","I think this happens because of how genetically similar humans are. Even though we all look and act different, there are many differences in our genetic code that create this. Because of this, I think it is really easy for someone else to share the opinions and feelings that I do. Thinking about statistically, it is very likely that someone in the world thinks like I do, and I may just happen to meet them.","I do not like conflict or confrontation. I usually avoid doing things that make people angry with me, so I am not typically in this situation. However, my mom does get angry with me when I get a piercing or tattoo, even though I only have one small one. This does not make me regret getting them, it just makes me frustrated with her that she can't understand that I am just trying to be myself. It makes me feel like she wants me to be myself in her terms and make her happy before I make myself happy. ","I have received a scholarship to attend UNC, so that might be my most recent ""award"". I received it for working hard in high school and being what they interpreted as a fit for their program. I swam on a club team in high school, earned good grades, and did a lot of philanthropy events in my community. I felt good about getting it, and proud of myself. However, now that I have it, it puts a lot of pressure and expectation on me to be perfect that is difficult to balance."
81892,"I am a christian and I am open to ideas of the spiritual realm. I would say I think they wanted to give me that final goodbye, and that these things don't just happen by coincidence. I don't really know how to answer the ""how"" of this question, but there's more to life than just this earth and what we can see and feel immediately. I've had several inexplicable gut feelings or dreams that prompted me to check on people, and I found that they weren't doing well and needed that.","I don't know, honestly. Sometimes people just click- whether that's from shared life experiences or similar upbringings or really just similar natures. I'm grateful for them, though. I think people can be placed into our lives for a reason, and sometimes it's clearer than others. It's always possible you did meet them a long time ago and reconnect- that's happened to me before. ","Probably for my neutrality and lack of commitment to things. I'm notoriously indecisive and always try to take the middle ground on matters, so I could imagine finding myself in the middle of two feuding friends and trying (and failing) to stay with both sides effectively. I hate conflict, especially with people I love, so this would be kind of terrible. It would be a little less upsetting if it was a stranger or someone I don't know as well, but I'm still too much of a people-pleaser to tolerate that.","My first instinct (jokingly) is an award for ""most efficient napper"" but that's probably not a real award I'd really want to receive. Realistically, I think I would receive an award from my friends for ""most likely to dig my deepest darkest secrets out of me when I didn't even know I needed to talk."" Over the course of my life, I've been blessed to have a lot of close friendships with people and have developed a strong sense of empathy, so I love having those kinds of conversations with people. I always try to create a safe place for my people where they know they can talk to me about anything, so I would be overjoyed to receive recognition for that. "
46584,"This happens because there must have been a deep connection and concern between me and the loved one, and who knows how dreams work but that could have been a sign of how important that person was for me. This was a tough one since I actually experienced this exact scenario a year ago. ",Maybe this was a deja vu or maybe this person physically looks like someone else that I am confusing them with.,They could be angry because I did something that affected their work or life. I do not feel very good about the situation because I would not want to have caused such a situation.,I received an award for being the resident with most achievements in my residency program. I feel great and proud about getting it. I was able to achieve it by putting a lot of hard work and effort into it.
60347,This actually sort of happened to me when my great-cousin Nellie passed. I have no other explanation as to why this happens other than my faith. Something tells me that their spirit is contacting me through my dreams.,"I know that sometimes people just click. It was like that with me and my best friend in high school and even though we don't talk as much today, we still share this feeling that we belong together in some way. As a Christian, I'm not supposed to believe in reincarnation but in the back of my mind I've thought that could have something to do with it. Mainly though, I just think certain people's energy and personalities match so well that even though they haven't known each other before there's an instant connection. In that situation it doesn't matter how long you've known someone because you two function so well together. ","The first thing that came to mind is my girlfriend being angry with me for being late which I am quite often, unfortunately. Of course I feel bad for not being there on time and inconveniencing her, but at the same time I feel irritated because at least I'm showing up so how can she be that mad. I guess this hypothetical idea comes from an overarching idea of feeling like I let people down.","The award I received was a Grammy - an award for musical accomplishment. I was able to achieve what brought me to the award by taking the time to invest in myself right now. To have talent is one thing, but to actually take the time to learn the technicalities of your craft is another. I built a strong foundation so that way when I branched out on just my own ideas and taste I was confident in knowing I was doing it for me. I feel extremely ecstatic, emotional, almost like I've finally ""made it"", probably reflective. "
84246,"I would interpret this as their spirit or something along those lines had visited me before going on to the afterlife. If something like this were to happen to me, especially if I didn't know that they were going to pass away, it would confirm my belief in the afterlife and religion. The reason that this would have happened would probably be, if they were far away, to see me one last time. I don't see my far-away relatives very often, maybe a once or twice a year. Reading this question make me think that I should probably visit them more.  ",There are some people you meet that have a personality that clicks well with your own. I think this happens mostly out of luck. There are so many people in this world it only makes statistical sense that a few of them will match your energy and it will feel very easy to be their friend. ,One of my close friends was angry with me over spring break because I went on a trip with another group of friends and did not invite her. She was angry with me because she wanted to go on a trip with me over spring break. I felt very complicated about the situation because my trip was only for 2 days and there was plenty of time for us to do something else together. But I also understand her viewpoint of being hurt and maybe a little jealous because I have definitely felt that way before. I talked with her though and the situation has been settled so everything is okay now. ,"There is not a specific award I am currently working towards so nothing really comes to mind when I try to think of something I would win. But if I were to win something I would have to work very hard for it and dedicate most of my time to getting it. When I finally did get the award it would make me very happy to reach my goal. However, I would also feel kind of empty because, now that I've reached what I've worked so hard for, what do I do with my life now?"
69956,"I think this happens through some higher power, though I'm not sure which one. I am a Christian, but I believe that the human mind can't comprehend the otherworldly stuff that happens in the afterlife. I think this happens due to the will of the person dying being strong enough to make a difference, and how badly they wanted to say goodbye allowed them to appear in a dream. My confidence for my answer is very low, mostly because I have accepted the fact that I just don't know much about spirituality or the afterlife.","I think that this happened because me and the other person really just clicked in our conversations and thoughts. I felt as though i knew what they were going to say, and I felt comfortable putting up counters to what they were going to argue. I also was able to freely express my own thoughts, without filtering anything at all. I also feel like I could joke around with them and truly be myself in their presence.","Most likely someone is angry at me because I'm late to something, but more likely, I just didn't express my true thoughts at some point, and blew a conversation or thought off like I didn't really care. We had a really deep conversation, and I didn't know how to respond, or rather how to put my thoughts into words, so instead I just gave a poor response. I feel awful about the situation because it has happened many times before with others. I try my best to communicate how I feel, but often times I end up putting myself in more trouble.","I received the award for accomplishing big things academically when no when thought that I could or believed in me. I was able to achieve this by ignoring/laughing off when I was put down for not being the smartest in the group, and rather than being upset, I just worked really hard to achieve academic success. I feel amazing about getting it. It was arguably one of the longest and hardest task that I've ever had, and there were very few people who even believe that i could do it."
67866,"This probably happens through some unknown force in the universe that is full of love and wisdom. I've heard of many occurrences like this happening, so this is a plausible scenario. I think this happens because sometimes loved ones don't get a chance to impart an important message to us before they go, so perhaps this unseen force gives them a chance to do that. This could also be a way for our sub-consciousnesses to deal with a death we may know is near.","If I met a person like this, it is probably because we have had many similar experiences in life. Specifically, I imagine that they had experienced some of the uniquely ""bad"" moments that I've also experienced that not many others would have. Alternatively, perhaps they have similar interests or reactions to events, making me feel immediately familiar with them. Finally, if I felt safe and comfortable in their presence, this would also help.","If someone is angry with me, it is likely because I was not as flexible or compromising as I could've been. I have a bad habit of stubbornness when I feel strongly on a subject. I probably feel justified and indignant in the moment, but will later on feel guilty and apologize. I'm not a fan of conflict, especially when I realize I'm in the wrong.","I probably received the award for some kind of leadership, as I would consider myself a good leader. To achieve this award, I would have been a good leader through listening to my team's thoughts and feelings, giving them tasks that match their strengths, and supporting them in their weakness or insecurity. I would feel very proud, as it makes me incredibly happy to lead people successfully. I never really want awards for good leadership, as a successful outcome for my team is a much better feeling."
20617,"i am a logical person, but i also believe there are some things that cannot be explained by our current understanding of the world. one of these things is the metaphysical (having a feeling about a situation, seeing ghosts, changes in energy, etc), i like to believe it's a power beyond my understanding. if this did happen, i would truly believe they tried to connect with me in their last moments. before my grandma died, i visited her in the hospital (not for the first time) and when I left i cried but couldn't explain why. that was the last time i was able to visit her before she passed, and i believe there was some higher power that gave me that gut feeling","i do believe that people have some kind of past lives, maybe not reincarnation but souls being imparted into other beings. i feel silly saying that, but i just think that there is some kind of conservation of matter/energy that causes people to be reborn in a sense. i would probably not put much serious thought into this feeling (unless they were able to mention things that directly pertained to my life, rather than just a deep sense of knowing), but i would appreciate the closeness we felt and try to maintain the relationship","they are upset with me because i perhaps said something callous or unthinking. I can sometimes say things offhandedly that hurt people more than i realize. depending on what i said, i might feel one of two ways. if they explain the situation and why theyre upset and it's a valid feeling, ill feel remorseful and try to right it by apologizing and reflecting. however if i think theyre being irrational or over emotional i might get more irritated than sorry.","i would like to receive an award for something i create. I do research as a grad student, so receiving recognition for a paper or presentation i did, or just my dedication to my work, would be great. i also do pottery, so if i received an award in some kind of art competition. i would feel fulfilled, grateful, proud of myself. i may also feel some imposter syndrome if i feel unprepared for the award."
49900,"I think that sometimes we are more emotionally connected and spiritually connected to the people that matter a lot to us. I believe that when we are not there to be with the people that we love, they may still be with us in spirit so to speak. I think that in this scenario, a far-away loved one was in a place or way  that we could not see them but still wanted us to know that we were loved by them before they pass. ","I like to think that maybe we are reincarnated in some sort of way. Like maybe in a previous life, we were a certain individual, and when we passed away, parts of our soul survived and became a part of a new person and body in a next life. I feel like when we meet someone for the first time and share an uncanny sense that we  have known each other for decades, we are meeting someone's soul that we knew from a previous life even though we don't know it. ","Someone may be angry with me because I am not spending enough time with them or giving them the attention they think I should be giving them (or maybe that I had previously promised to give them). I tend to overexert myself and try to do too many things in a short amount of time, therefore leading me to not have enough time to spend with certain people that I care deeply about (like my boyfriend, friends, and sisters). I would feel guilty in the situation and try to make it right by hanging out with them more consistently, and trying to modify my schedule to be more accommodating, as well as not make promises that I may not be able to keep. ","I received the award for creating additional educational and social opportunities and other forms of assistance for my community. I was able to achieve the award with a lot of help and inspiration from my friends, colleagues, and peers, as well as my family. I felt proud about getting the award, and wanted to share it with the people that helped me get where I was at that point, as well as with the community with which I worked with. "
48194,This has never happened to me (thank goodness) but if it did I would most definitely attribute it to God and feel comforted by it.  ,This happened to me my senior year of undergrad. Reminds me of Anne of Green Gables and finding a kindred spirit. We had so much in common from our interests to how we were raised with enough differences to keep it interesting. I'm thankful to God for it. ,"If people are angry with me without what I view as just cause (I've done nothing wrong) I am also angry. If there is just cause (I've done something wrong) I'm usually panicked, upset, worried and want to rectify the situation quickly. Sometimes too quickly. Usually people are upset if I've said something too bluntly and they took it a way I did not mean. I usually feel bad about that and then second guess things I say to them after the fact. ","I did get an award my senior year of high school for character at my dance studio. I didn't feel as though it was entirely deserved as no one went out of their way that year to do anything spectacular for others and I was a senior and had just been my normal self seems like I was just a left over choice perhaps. I was happy they tried to honor me in some way because I put in a lot of work there (taught the younger kids, helped keep the studio clean, stayed after performances to clean up and helped monitor dressing rooms etc.) but it also felt a little undeserved and I didn't love being the center of attention. "
50441,I would have no idea why it happened. I would probably say it's a sign from God or something and try to live by that life wisdom. I would probably fall short of that commitment pretty often as I would forget it after a week or two and then only remember it every once in awhile. I think I would just try to live like they would have wanted me to live.,"Sometimes you just meet people that grew up in similar circumstances as you or faced similar problems as you. For example, a middle class Hispanic family or both of you being gay. The other reason why is when your personalities mesh well. If you're both honest and caring for other people and each other, you can quickly develop a bond and how you guys will interact with one another.","I am a very honest, sometimes blunt person. In this scenario, they are angry with me because I honestly told them what I was feeling about them. In this situation, I would feel two emotions. The first being that I need to stick with what I said because it is the truth and honesty is the best policy. The second is regret because some things don't need to be said and I have a difficult time differentiating the two.","I received the Military Officers Association of America Award in High School. I was able to do so by doing well in school and helping out / afterschool activities with NJROTC. I worked really hard, not knowing I'd receive that award. It made me feel really good that my hard work had translated into something tangible."
75312,"I think dreams are really interesting, and they communicate parts of us that we are not consciously aware of. I know that my dreams tend to be very life-like to the point where when I wake up, I can't discern what has actually happened versus what I remember from the dream (luckily I don't remember my dreams very frequently.) A phenomenon like what was described above could be some occurrence that we can't explain yet, but can be explained now as fate. ","When I first meet someone, I tend to be very formal. I still make small jokes and am very energetic, but there is a type of humor and behavior I take on after knowing someone for a long time. For example, I let myself be very goofy around my closest friends, and I don't feel the need to be very put together, because I know that they already know what kind of person I am. I feel that if I am comfortable enough to go into this more carefree behavior with this new person, I would feel like I knew them for a long time already.","Someone may be angry with me if I said the wrong thing, or didn't communicate correctly. Sometimes if I am discussing a topic that I feel strongly about, I speak before I fully process the situation and what impact my words would have on the other person in the conversation. I tend to feel really guilty whenever this happens, and even if the other party doesn't express that they are upset, I will proactively apologize.","I feel that I would receive an award for dependability in the classroom. I do participate in lab work through BMME, but on paper, my achievements in the lab are not very substantial. Similarly, I perform well in class, but I don't think my grades should be the reason for receiving an award. I always try my best to participate in class and help my peers if they don't understand a concept being presented, and while this shouldn't warrant an award, I feel that I would be grateful that this quality was being acknowledged."
23793,"I think this happens because it is God's way of letting us say goodbye to our loved one's before they depart.  Before my grandfather passed, I had a dream about him and felt his presence.

","I don't really believe in reincarnation or anything like that, but I guess it could be an idea that you knew them in another life or another timeline.  Or that you just recognize their face from somewhere.  Or that they remind you of a close friend or family member because they share similar qualities. ",If somebody is angry with me it is probably because I did something stupid honestly.  I sometimes don't think before I do things and have accidentally hurt someone's feelings in the past.  I would feel quite guilty about the situation and I would do anything I can do make the person feel better and make sure they are not mad at me anymore. ,"I imagine that I could receive an award for being noticed for my effort.  I do not always get the outcomes that I hope for, so I often am not recognized for ""achievement"" per se.  However, I work extremely hard at what I do.

28409,"I think that there might be a deeper connection in life to those whom you share a close bond with. I think it is their spirit giving you a final goodbye before they depart. If you share a close bond with someone or spend a lot of time with them, then they might show up in your dreams more often. Your dreams may play out subconscious feelings that you may have.","I think this happened because in the past I have either met someone that looks like them or has the same personality as them. This happened to me a couple years ago and I am still friends with her today, so i think this happened because i was supposed to meet her and know that I can be comfortable with her. These types of people, depending on whether you get a good or bad feeling about them, are supposed to play a part in your life story.","If someone is angry with me it is probably because i told them what they needed to hear instead of what they wanted to hear. If i do this i probably don't do it in the nicest way, so it would cause them to be angry towards me. If this is the situation, I don't feel too bad about it. I do not regret the message behind what i would say but i would probably rethink how i could have said it in a nicer way.",I received an award for getting the highest grade on my exam. I was able to achieve this by studying a lot and actively learning material. I feel good about getting this award. I am proud of the work that i put into it.
72457,"I think that this is probably a coincidence, since I don't think that humans can visit each other in dreams. However, I do believe God controls everything (including coincidences) and could have made this particular coincidence happen. Maybe I need the life advice, or maybe God knows that it will help me in the future to have had the dream. I do believe in prophetic dreams, but this doesn't seem like a prophetic dream (since it didn't say anything about the future or about God) and prophetic dreams are very, very rare.","That sounds like one of three things. Maybe we have met before and don't remember it (maybe we were in kindergarten together and were friends then, but don't remember it now). Maybe it's deja vu. Maybe the person I just met is a lot like someone I do know. Either way, I think it's just a weird thing that doesn't happen for a particular reason.

68900,"You know, my gut instinct was to say that such things aren't real at all. But, I've had some mysterious moments in my life, none of which have led me to think there is some sort of benevolent higher power, but which have led me to think that there is definitely a lot about consciousness and connection and the world around us that we simply don't understand. So it could be that there is some kind of connection that people can have that allows people to communicate in ways that go beyond what we would consider normal. It sounds crazy to type that, but I am at least open to something like this occurring (even if it is unlikely)","I think this happens because sometimes people just vibe really well together. i experienced this with my partner, and i don't think there is any unscientific explanation for why this happens. rather, i think based on our own psychological and evaluative profile there are certain people who are really good fits for us and complement these things really well. ","I think the most likely reason why someone would get angry with me is for saying something that upset them. sometimes i speak a little impulsively and i might say something offensive or hurtful. my heart rate would definitely increase if someone was angry with me, and i would probably feel anxious. i might feel some guilt as well if i said something that i could see was wrong or hurtful. if i thought the person was angry even though what i said was totally okay (like if I said something about being LGBTQ) I would probably ALSO get angry and not feel guilt. ","Im guessing I can just choose any award even if i don't actually deserve it right now! If i could choose any award, it would probably be some kind of award for writing or teaching about mindfulness. I would have been able to achieve this award through a lot of hard work and research, but also through years of practicing mindfulness and making it a priority in my life to learn how to deeply enjoy my life and help others to transform their suffering and cultivate more compassion, joy, and mindfulness. 

If i were ever to get an award like this, it would probably be one of the highlights of my life and i would feel overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness!"
16930,"Logically speaking I feel like I would believe it was just a coincidence or perhaps because I had been thinking of them before I went to sleep. However, I would consider the possibility that they came to ma as a spirit or whatever they may be. I don't pretend to know everything about the world or after life and I wouldn't automatically rule this out as a possibility. ","I feel like this would be a very interesting situation. I feel like it would be similar to having found a 'soul mate'. I love being able to get along with people very easily. I feel like social interactions are very draining for me and to be able to get along with someone very easily, as if I had known them for decades would make me like this person a lot. I would try to keep them as a close friend. ","If someone is angry with me I would be very concerned. Especially if I didn't know the reason they were angry with me. I would like to think of myself as an open communicator. I would go up to them and apologize for making them feel the way they are, I would ask them if they could help me explain why they are angry with me. I would then try to come to an agreement with them and attempt to explain my side of the story and see where the miscommunication came up. ","I plan on going into psychological services in the future. I would imagine I received the award for something related to that, for helping people out or giving back to my community. I feel like I would be slightly embarrassed to receive the award but in the end I would be mostly happy. I like to think I am a hardworking individual and I achieved the award through perseverance and hard work. "
50538,"I think that this was just a coincidence, the happening of the dream and the death happening in the same night. I think that we dream things that are relevant and impactful to us and involve what we like to think about, and I think that this happened to coincide with the death of a loved one. Part of me believes that the loved one wanted me (in this situation) to know that they loved me and to pass on information and that my brain subconsciously knew these things and decided to present them to me, coincidentally on the night of their death. ",I think that I would feel this way with someone if they shared characteristics or patterns of speech with someone that I have known before in my life. I remember lots of small and meaningful details about the people who are (or were once) in my life and I am often reminded of them. I think that if I were to feel this connection with someone I am meeting for the first time it would be because they are reminding me of someone who was once important to me. ,"I would be deeply upset that someone is angry with me- not because I think that they don't or shouldn't be upset with me, but because I would be upset that I gave them a reason to be angry at me. If someone were to be angry at me it would most likely be because I was too dismissive of what they wanted to do on a vacation I am on with them. In some situations I really like to have control over the plans, and it is one of the times where I am most likely to not care about what the other person thinks and take control over the situation. In my daily life I am constantly thinking about how to avoid making people upset with me and try to only be good. ","An award I would most likely to receive would be the most valued employee at my job. I put in lots of effort while I am there to connect with my coworkers, both emotionally and in terms of teamwork, and I am constantly working to get better. I enjoy (and am good at) interacting with customers and it has kept a lot of people coming back to the store. I was able to achieve this by bringing a positive attitude to work every day and being sure to actively listen to the customers and meet them where they are. I would feel proud to get this award, as it would be proof of all of my hard work and intentional communication with both customers and my coworkers. "
68301,"I would think that my deep emotional connection to my parent allowed me, subconsciously, to pick up on clues about my parent's impending doom in our most recent interactions. My brain wants to work out the deep love I have for them before they disappear from my life. Humans, at their core, really just want to be loved and cared for by those close to them. My dream would be representative of the weight of this relationship in my life, and how I can start to process their passing.","Sometimes when people have similar life experiences, their able to instantly relate on an unusual level. When I ""click"" with people, I feel like our brains are in sync, and we momentarily see the world in the same way. I constantly seek to be understood, and when someone does understand my experiences, it can feel like we've known each other for longer. This person is probably coming into my life right when I need them.","This person is angry with me for trying to manipulate them into dating me. It's totally reasonable for them to be mad at me. I shouldn't have done and said the things I did but I was unable to control myself when these events took place. I respect their reaction to the situation, and all I can do is try to regulate my behavior better in the future, to avoid the same thing happening again.","I got an award from my experimental work on the nature of black holes. I got this award from years of physics and math work in undergrad, where I made monumental strides in relativity. My colleagues and I all spent hours in the laboratory, modeling how matter interacts with black holes. The award is for me and my colleagues work, a combination of luck and labor."
15015,"I would see it as some sort of turning point in my life. I'm of the belief that many things in life happen without an explanation, and they may be the consequences of higher forces like karma and whatnot. If this happens, then perhaps there is something that needs to be told to me.","The most likely explanation could be that we share a ton of similarities. Even if this is the first time I've met someone, I feel like they're already my best friend if we have a lot that we can relate to and discuss. This could be anything from games to schooling, and my introverted self would quickly open up.","My feelings depend on the situation; I feel like if I did anything wrong, then I would feel guilty and they deserve to be angry at me. Otherwise, I would simply ignore them.","Maybe I received the award for performing well on a math. This comes with hours upon hours of studying a wide variety of topics. It entails making sure that I have thought out every possible contingency for what could happen before, during, or after whatever I earned an award on. I'd feel jubilant at the award."
89997,"If my grandmother visits me in a dream to impart wisdom and I find out they had died when this dream occurs, I would point toward the spiritual to explain this event. I cannot think of a reason to that would explain this rationally. As a person of faith,I would think this is spiritual. From an academic viewpoint, it may be seen as inexplicable or as fate. This is a hard topic to grasp at from a purely scientific viewpoint.","We meet at lunch and he shares about his childhood and recent experiences, I feel a sense of connection after only knowing him for a few minutes. The connection is not solely because of shared experiences but a mutual understanding of each other. He likes to do activities with church, is psychologically aware, and perceptive of many different things. I am open to his perspectives, as he is open to mine.",They are probably angry at me for running my mouth about something I should not have mentioned. I feel at fault because it is completely avoidable. The situation is tense between the two of us and I try to apologize to no avail. I realize only time can heal.,I would have gotten the away for cooking well! I was able to do this by cooking each week for a large crowd. I feel elated because I am recognized for something I enjoy doing. This would make me feel beyond happy.
84654,"While I am not religious, I am a spiritual person and I like to view the world in a way in which individuals and souls are connected on a higher level. I think this phenomenon may happen because it is that loved one's way of imparting their last goodbye. Some people may believe that their passed away loved ones manifest in certain energies or indicate certain signs. While I am not 100% certain about whether I believe in this, I think it is possible and that belief helps me and other individuals look for deeper meanings in our relationships and connections while we are alive.","Similar to the concept of soulmates, I believe that there are people on this Earth who naturally possess energies that are drawn to one another. I like to view this as an explanation behind the phrase of just ""clicking with someone,"" because you may have grown up in similar (or maybe possibly different) environments and been influenced to develop compatible personalities with someone else. For example, while I have had many close friends over my life, the dynamic between myself and my current best friend transcends our friendship of about 5 years. It feels like we've known each other for much longer, and it's because of our high compatibility and the fact that we were drawn to each other as friends.","Someone may be angry with me because of something that I said, as sometimes I accidentally say a wrong or insensitive thing. I would feel very anxious and guilty in the situation, as the person did not understand my lack of ill will. I tend to speak my mind very bluntly every now and then, so I don't realize that the meaning of my words may be misconstrued. I would want to explain myself and apologize so that the person does not feel as bad about themselves in that situation.","While I'm unsure of any award I would receive, one that may come to mind is an award for club leadership. I am the president of a club, and I have worked very hard this semester to make sure that it has a presence in UNC Clubs. The past few years, it has been quite inactive and I wanted to make an active change. I have collaborated with the club advisors to invite guest speakers to meetings and involve the club in a large career panel event this semester. I would feel happy to receive it, but I'm not sure that I would be worthy of the award, as my work would not be possible without my executive council and the enthusiasm of my club members."
97131,"I think as they went through life, they made certain mistakes that has defined them. I think they see these mistakes as things that they do not really think about or acknowledge during their life. I'm believe in spirits and I think someone dreaming of their loved ones in this way is the loved one's way of admitting their mistakes before they move on. ","In a scientific sense, the person I met may have a very similar personality to someone I met in the past. Whoever that person was may have had a big impact in my life. In a mystical sense, maybe we have met each other in a past life and residual memories from that life may have carried over to both of us now in this life.","They are angry with me because I engaged with someone they liked or had recently broken up with. Feeling lonely, I was desperate for someone to be with and because of that, my decisions were clouded. I feel terrible about the decision and I would do anything within reason to make it right between me and the person i angered.",I received the Nobel Prize for being the first to successfully to perform a brain transplant on a human. I achieved this by studying hard and making sure that I did not lose sight of my goal. I feel so empowered and happy that i got the award. It also makes me happy that I made my family proud in the process.
72241,I think it would be my sister who visits me because she has always been my number one person to go to when I need advice or help. I trust her with my life and I know she would want what is best for me. I think because we have such a  special connection she would want to say goodbye to me. I also think that being away from each other makes us think about each other a lot so it would be very probable for me to have dreams about visiting each other.,"Sometimes when I make eye contact with someone, I feel like we make a strong connection and can mimic each others facial expressions to show trust. I would be able to identify the person who I would have known for decades by seeing how comfortable they feel with me and how I feel speaking to them. If we are close, the conversation will be seamless and we would lose track of time while speaking to each other. ","Sometimes people are angry with me because I do not tell them things about myself that they would have wanted to know. The parts I do not tell them are not parts of me I feel embarrassed about, but they are things that I feel like other people wouldn't care about. My friends would be upset with me because it seems as though I don't trust them, but in reality I am just bad at communicating things.","I hope to have received the award for doing good for my community. It would be most meaningful to me if I was able to provide for people who need it and uplift them in any way. I would feel great about winning it, but I know that one accomplishment would most likely not ameliorate the issue altogether. Hopefully I would have worked with a team to achieve our goal because working together with others helps me develop better ideas and ways to put those ideas into action. "
22541,"I think this happens as a result of both your subconscious and the interconnectedness of beings. I feel like we can sense energy shifts happening around us-- similar to when people notice the ""vibe"" of a room. A person's death is a big shift that sets of a series of reactions in the body and mind. Sensing that death when it is happening even when you are asleep most likely prompts intensive thinking about the person or in this case dreams about their final words of wisdom. ","I think some people simply click. It can be a mixture of charisma, similar life experience, or just a shared experience that is powerful in the moment. I don't necessarily believe in past-life connections, but I do think that some people are more compatible than others. The true test in my mind isn't if you feel deeply connected in those first few interactions but rather if that feeling lasts longer term.","They are angry with me because I didn't follow through on something I said i would do or I withheld information from them. I didn't accurately assess how much time or energy I needed to complete something and took extra time to do it as a result. This is often true with being late to social plans, not getting something to someone on time, etc. I feel stressed and somewhat dejected about the situation because when I made the commitment I truly believed I could do it. The fact that I couldn't follow through which prompted their anger is disheartening and I'm stressed about resolving the issue.  ",I received the award for academic achievement/ leadership. I was able to get the award because of my high academic performance and my tendency to work in leadership roles. I am excited to get the award but also know that it just means I have to push for the next prestigious thing. I have been in this position a number of times and feel lucky each time but also worry that this is the primary measure of my worth. 
94406,They wanted to tell me something before they died. They must have had something they wanted to tell me before they died and they were thinking of me before they died. I believe that dreams do sometimes predict or represent things from real life. I would choose to believe they wanted me to know that they left in peace and wanted me to know that they are ok now and that they cared for me while they were alive. ,"I probably have met someone who had the same vibes as they did. They reminded me of someone I did know. Or they perfectly match my energy that it feels like I could have known them and can know them forever. A small part of me believes in ""maybe I knew them in a past life"" but it doesn't fully align with my beliefs so I try not to think that. I have met someone like that and it makes me uncomfortable to feel like I have known them yet know nothing really about who they are and what they mean in my life. It feels like a trap. ",They are angry because I lied. I'm not sure what it would be about but if someone were to be angry with me it would have had to be a lie that hurt them. It must have betrayed their trust or directly harmed them. I feel awful and I feel like crying. I never want people to be upset with me or feel like I did something to hurt them. I hate the feeling when someone is mad at me and I want to do everything possible to make it go away and fix the situation so we are ok with each other.,"I imagine the award I received is for best employee or an award for the hospital for the work I've done as a PA. I definitely would have worked hard and cared for my patients. I focus a lot of energy on my work and I would have given 100% to my job. I feel satisfied and I feel relief. I'm not sure why relief, maybe as validation that the work I have done is worthy. But also satisfied that I did something right and it meant something to others."
72736,This dream is like she/he comes to my dream to forecast the future. And she/he only wanted me to know that she/he loves me and want me to be happy in the future. It might happen but I don't wish it happens.,"One day, I visit the museum and meet a guy. He looks very familiar but I don't know him at all. It seems that he appeared in my dream in the past. I think it's a miracle.","They might be angry with me because I mess things up. For example, I did a poor job on doing my job when I work. So my boss was angry and wanted to fire me. I feel uneasy and regret.","I received the award for doing a research about organizational behavior. I am going to write a honor thesis paper on it. So I will definitely research more and study harder. If I get it, I will feel happy and excited."
21492,"I think that this happens because when we are thinking about someone we love, we dream about them. I think that we have deep connections to our family and friends and that we can sense when something happens to them or if they are in trouble. I have dreamed about my loved ones getting into a car accident or going through a breakup and then it happened in real life. I think that our subconscious is powerful and that we think about the people that we love even when we don't realize.","I feel an uncanny sense of connection to someone when I share the same taste in music as someone. I feel that music is a good way to see someone's interests, and I love looking at a person's Spotify playlists to see into their personality. When I see that someone listens to a lot of the same artists and songs that I do, I feel like we have a lot in common. I think that this is because I have a fairly unique grouping of musicians that I listen to so it is somewhat uncommon for me to meet people that like the same music as me.",They are probably angry with me because I accidentally told a secret. I sometimes tell people things I shouldn't and have too much trust in people. I feel guilty because I know that I should be more respectful to people's privacy and not share things about them they do not want to be spread to others. I know that I should not gossip or spread drama but I forget sometimes.,"If I were to receive an award, I think that it could be for being a good roommate and doing extra chores around the house. I often take the time and go out of my way to tidy things up and clean when I know that my roommates are busy and don't have as much time as me to clean, but they value having a clean living environment. I would feel appreciated for receiving this award and it would be comforting to be recognized for my acts of service to my roommates."
13656,"I believe in fate to an extent, and that things work themselves out the way they are supposed to. However, I'm not particularly religious, and I don't really believe in stuff like this. Even if there is an afterlife, which is not an idea that I'm opposed to at all, this is something that just seems to farfetched to me.","I think this can happen fairly often. I think part of the reason is that a lot of people have similar experiences at some point throughout their lives, and I think people tend to try to relate to others. So it is probably fairly easy to feel like you have a lot in common with someone you've just met. I actually think a lot of times, as you get to know a person better, you realize you have less in common with them than you originally thought and it turns out that you just have had a few fairly common connecting experiences, but are fairly different people.","I think someone might get angry with me because I tend to be a rule follower, which sometimes pisses people off. I probably wouldn't say anything to a stranger who is doing something they're not supposed to, but I might express judgement towards a friend/acquaintance who was cheating on exam or homework or breaking a law, even a more minor one. If it is something they see as not that big of a deal (because I often care about following rules that people don't care as much about), they might get angry with me over that. Obviously I don't like people being angry with me, and I would probably feel angry that they were mad at me when they were the one doing something wrong and therefore causing the issue.","I guess if I were to receive an award I think it would be for putting all my effort into work and trying to be a team player, though I don't really think that's something to necessarily receive an award for. I don't particularly try to stand out or do much that I feel like would be recognized by an award. I would certainly be happy to receive an award, but also a little uncomfortable, because I don't like being the center of attention. I like to do my best and I do often times feel like I care more about the effort I put into some things than some others, but I don't need any special recognition for that; I think actions speak for themselves and that's enough."
46610,I consider myself to be a spiritual person so if this ever happened to me I would think that it is the soul of that person reaching out to me in another dimension to give me this advice and to have their goodbye. I think some people share a special connection that would cause this to happen.,I think this happens when there is a mutual sense of trust and curiosity in the conversation and a lot of shared interests. I think that sometimes there are just people who make you feel better about yourself and leave you with the sense that you can talk nonstop for ages and not run out of conversation. There are also some people that make you want to see them again and having them be important to your life.,I do not like it when people are angry at me. One idea is a friend getting angry because I forgot I had made plans with them. I feel horrible for forgetting.,I am not sure what I would have won the award for. One idea could be winning the award for good grades this semester and I achieved that through hard work and perseverance. I feel proud of myself.
95878,"Sometimes the subconscious brain has a really funny way of being aware of things that we haven't consciously been aware of yet. While I do not particularly believe in the afterlife  or something extra out there orchestrating things, if this were to happen, I would definitely question it more. On a much smaller scale, this morning (my phone was on silent too), I was waking up and my brain formed a picture in my head of a notification popping up on my screen with a text from a specific friend. I had no reason to believe this so I opened my eyes and 1 min ago there was a text from that friend. It felt so weird cuz I don't know how my brain came up with that, but I think it can be tied to a weird 6th sense. The brain is able to make connections that we would never be able to consciously, so I believe that we would be aware of the sudden change and the brain forms those images in your sleep to make you aware/soothe the upcoming pain.  ","I actually experienced this with one of my current roommates. I had never met her my whole life until this school year but apparently our lives were quite similar, and lived/experienced things adjacent to each other. When our lives finally crossed, it was so uncanny and we spent a long time breaking down our lives and amazing ourselves on the similarities and in shock how we hadn't met beforehand. It was like meeting a long lost sister/friend and it felt like a piece was finally filled in my life ( a piece I didn't even know was missing). ",I would imagine that I disappointed them in some way or acted in a way that crossed their personal boundaries. I would be upset and apologetic for doing that and imagine that I was some sort of massive miscommunication. I would be so guilty and try to do everything in my power to make them feel better or make it up to them. I don't like it when people are upset at me (unless the person doesn't have much meaning in my life and even then the idea irks me). ,"All of the awards I've received thus far have been from academic achievements so I could only imagine that it would be related to that. Maybe at my future job, I would receive an award for doing an excellent job or starting something new and successful within the company. My drive and intelligence would bring me the opportunity to receive it. I would be thrilled and happy for my work to be recognized. Being recognized for your hard work is such a fulfilling experience and it drives me to do even more. "
35017,I feel that this would happen in a situation where this person was very important to me and I would have loved to spend more time with them and build a stronger bond but never actually got to do that. I don't think that this specific sequence of events has any reason; it could just be a coincidence. But I know I would be extremely devastated if something like this happened. I'd feel deprived of a connection that I could have had.,"I think this would be a sign to keep them close. Life plays out in surprising ways, and it is very hard to build close relationships with people. Even after years of being friends with some people, it is still hard to feel like you've seen all sides of them and that you can stay fully connected with them. Finding someone like that is definitely an indication that this person will add meaning to your life, and that you met them for a reason.","We probably had a disagreement. I usually do not tend to engage in disputes unless I feel that my opinion has been disrespected. Maybe they said something that diminishes my thoughts and experiences and I said something hurtful back. They may be angry at me because they were hurt by what I said. I would not feel comfortable with the situation. Ideally, I'd like to talk it out and help them understand how I felt.","I probably received an award for the work that I do for my community. I run an international non-profit student-led organization that makes educational, mentorship, and service opportunities available for students interested in neuroscience. I am VERY passionate about my work because of the impact, and if I were to receive an award, it would probably be because someone recognized the impact of all my effort. I would feel very good about it because I often feel that my work goes unnoticed. I'd feel very appreciated."
51956,i think this would of happened and that this was irony and think god was tryoing to tell me something by having. that special someone come to tell me that. i would have been so grateful for that person to have to tell me me that.i dont wish this on me but would be grateful.,i dont know why this would have happended very strange,i would never want someone to be angry with me. but if someone was i would be so sad .

46311,"Being Catholic, I would expect this to be the work of God. I'm not certain of all the metaphysics which would enable this specific phenomenon to occur or be detectable to me. But, the why is easier to answer. I would suppose that it was part of the divine will for me to know a particular thing, presumably for me to act upon it, and hear it from a loving voice that I trust so that I will take it seriously.",I suspect this happened because they might have some attributes similar to a person or several persons I have encountered before and found memorable for some reason. It could also be the product of the same mental state that leads to a sense of deja vu. ,"I'm not sure why they would be angry with me. Perhaps I said or did something thoughtless that bothered them. Or perhaps they were having a rough day and I happened to be the person they ran into when they snapped. I feel taken aback at first, but then introspective because it could well be my fault.","I received the award for something I did that was beneficial to or appreciated by a significant number of people. I'm not sure what specifically that would be, since I don't tend to try for the spotlight. I was able to achieve whatever brought me to the award by working hard and staying focused on the task at hand. I feel great about getting the award, but the next question in my mind is: what next?"
76344,"I think that I was supposed to hear what they had to say before they died. I think I should use this wisdom in my life whenever possible. I think I was a valued person in their life for them to visit me before death. I also think it could just be coincidence but if it's good advice, why not listen?","I think all people share common humanity. To some extent, I think hurting them would actually be hurting myself. I think open-mindedness is prioritized within my age group. ","They are angry with me for not reading my texts and not being clear enough about where I was, when. My repeated pattern of behavior led to them being angry with me. They feel like if I cared enough I would communicate more frequently. I feel frustrated and discouraged. I know my communication style is not indicative of how much I care about my friends.","I received the award for my psychological theory of life fulfillment book. 
Discipline, passion, resilience, and self-trust led me to receiving this award. I feel great. My hard work paid off."
94869,"I would think that this happens so that in the time after their passing I could be reminded to not let conversations like that be a dream. Take advantage of the time that we do have with loved ones to have real conversations so that when they pass or we pass, the other isn't left longing for conversations that could have happened.",I think that this could happen for two reasons. This may happen because myself and the individual just click really well. Another reason that this could happen is if there is something like reincarnation this could be at play. Either way that feeling of knowing one another for 10 years shows a strong connection.,I think someone would be angry with me for shutting down on them and not really being vocal about my feelings. Literally anything could lead to someone being mad at me because I will shutdown at the most random times. I would feel bad on the inside but because I feel the need to make myself feel good I would be defensive and in the moment feel as no one should be mad at me on the outside.,I would be receiving an award for most improvement in physics. I achieved this award because I went from failing my tests to getting a B on the most recent one. I also started doing the homework without getting any help. I would feel proud to be getting this award.
37994,"I think this would happen just as a way of this loved one trying to remind you that they love you and are thinking about you. I think it is just the subconscious of them and yourself that can somehow connect  in a dream form once they die. I am not really sure how it exactly happens, or if there is somehow a God that is able to make this happen. I think the mutual love for one another made it happen ",I think this would have happened because I have a bad memory and sometimes I cannot quite remember people. I would probably know that they seem familiar but cannot remember exactly who they are. It would probably happen at a place I least expect to see this person.,The person would be angry with me because I had let them down or did something to upset them. In this situation I would have not done the right thing or was not there when they needed me. I was too busy focusing on other things and not so much them. I feel bad and guilty about the situation and wish I could have done better.,I would get an award for helping other people in some big way. I was able to do this by helping people who are less fortunate or worse off then I am. Specifically I would  be able to help adoptees with adoption trauma. I would feel really proud that I was able to give back to my community. 
51962,"I think there's a lot that we as humans don't understand about consciousness and ourselves. People do have these things happen to them and I think there might be a unique gift that these people have. The people I've known who've had this experience have both had a lot going on with them mentally, so maybe some mental/ behavioral health challenges aren't disorders at all and are just indicative of something we don't understand. ","I don't know if I believe in past lives, but maybe if the connection were really strong I would. My more logical answer would be that we had many of the same past experiences (emotionally & mentally) that shaped us. ","Someone would probably be angry with me for switching my mind or opinion or thoughts on something, if they were to be angry with me. I'm happy that I'm an open-minded person but definitely get angry with myself for not being firm in my thoughts and beliefs and telling white lies when I'm uncomfortable.  ",I would like to receive an award for some kind of mental health advocacy work. I would have achieved the award by working hard and using my struggle for good. I'd feel really happy and fulfilled. 
53727,"I am not a very strong believer in God, but I do feel as thought there is some higher power out there in the universe. It often shows itself through acts like this. I would not consider this a coincidence, or a random occurrence. Something of this magnitude has to have been curated somehow, I don't think that luck or chance can lead to this.","This actually happened to me last year. I think we felt that way because we actually had a lot in common, and we were able to discern that fairly quickly. We had a nearly identical cultural background, similar life experiences, and similar worldviews. However, I still think that I could meet someone that is wildly different than me and share that uncanny sense that we've known each other forever. If you really get to know each other, not just on a surface-level basis, and you find a sense of trust and understanding which usually takes years to develop, then you've found that sense.","They are angry with me probably because I said something I shouldn't have said and it was insulting towards them. There are times where I don't have a filter, so I say stupid things that hurt people's feelings. In those cases, I feel a sense of shame and regret for having said something that I perceived as innocent but that made someone else feel bad. I would do whatever I could to make them feel better, but it's not always easy, as I am the one who made them angry in the first place.","I probably received an award for one of my passions, whether it be competitive ballroom dancing, academics, are something within my religious youth group. I achieved whatever it is the award is for through hard work. I am not naturally talented at many things, so this award would have been received through diligent and consistent work. I feel honored to be recognized. But, at the same time, I feel as though I haven't done enough and that others deserve to be recognize more than I do. I have never been a fan of awards. "
74662,"I can't think of a reason why the loved one's death and the dream would be connected, or how the death of the loved one would cause me to have a dream; I think the only reason I would have a dream in this case is purely because of coincidence. However, I may have had such a dream because I was thinking a lot about this loved one recently, and perhaps things they told me in the past were freshly in my mind. I don't think there is any extra-physical/spiritual connection between people, and as far as I know the only motivator for dreams is your mental activity, both conscious and subconscious. Thus, the only way I think this could have happened is that I was thinking a lot about this loved one and they just happened to die during that particular night.","I don't think there is any reason why this would happen other than that we both had similar upbringings, life experiences, and personality traits. In other words, I think the only way this could have happened is if we have similar ways of thinking and experienced similar things in life, which would result in us being quite similar to each other. This could perhaps result in us feeling like we have known each other for a long time. I don't believe there is any spiritual connection or anything like that that could have connected us; we would merely have been prepared by our lives to be very similar. This isn't dependent upon fate or gods or anything spiritual; it only relies on random chance.","They are probably angry with me because I didn't understand or wasn't able to empathize with some trouble they were going through. I led them to be angry with me by showing that I didn't empathize with them or being oblivious to their hurt. I would probably feel confused, frustrated, and a bit annoyed that they are angry with me, because I strongly believe that you should solve your own problems and that complaining to others/getting others to feel sorry for you is counterproductive and a waste of time. In general, I believe logical thinking, pragmatic approaches to problems, and detachment from emotion is quite important in solving issues effectively, but I do realize that this will probably alienate me from many people or result in people being angry with me.","I received the award for technical innovation and excellence in a specific field. I achieved this award by working hard, teaching myself, dedicating a majority of my life to whatever I won the award for, and by being creative and thinking outside the box. I would feel very happy and fulfilled for getting this award, because it shows that what I am doing is valuable and that I am contributing to that field. In general, I would only be happy to receive an award if I felt I had worked hard enough to earn it."
48025,"I think somehow they wanted to send me a message, to tell me they loved me or grant me some wisdom one last time. There isn't really an explanation for it. I am a Christian, so I do believe that those who believe in Christ will achieve everlasting life. In some ways, I think God sends those to comfort us, to show us that we have an angel looking out for us. Sometimes it might come in a form of a dream, other times its other signs in the world around us, like a certain animal, sound, scent or other cue that meant a lot to that person. Somehow, somewhere that person is able to show us that they are ok, and to remind us that they love us. ","I think our souls knew each other before, or just sense a familiar soul. I am not quite sure how our souls know each other, as it is very weird to think about it and attempt to figure out how that happened. On the other hand, I do also just think sometimes that people's personalities are just the right mix to get along so perfectly, its just the right mix of the right traits that make them fit right in with each other and feel as if they have known each other for a long time. Maybe they even remind them of someone they once knew and/or loved.","I'm not sure why they are angry with me, as I am usually too shy to ask why, although it is probably because I didn't go along with the plan or do what they thought I would do. I feel very anxious about approaching and dealing with the situation, although I do have a lot of other feelings about things. I feel angry as well, and probably upset that someone is angry with me.They probably became angry with me because I get very emotional when dealing with certain situations, which usually escalates certain situations very quickly.","I received the award for some new scientific breakthrough. I was able to achieve this award through lots of hard work, many mistakes (learning from them as I went), and working with a team of other individuals, who bring different skills than I to the table. I feel absolutely amazing about getting this reward, as if this was what I was meant to do, as if it was my life's calling."
41639,"I don't personally have a strong stance on the afterlife or the supernatural, so I'm not sure how or why that would happen. It could be that the dream was influenced by thinking about that person if they are in a situation in which they aren't doing well. I know that some people believe that they are visited by their loved one after death, which I wouldn't rule out. In general, I'm not sure.","I think there are certain things about other people that make it easy to connect with them and to identify certain things that you have in common. Some people just click and get along really well. Sometimes there's just an innate understanding and mutual connection. I don't necessarily think that this has anything to do with past lives, although I also wouldn't rule out that possibility.","The first thing that came to my mind is that someone in my family is angry with me for disagreeing with them about politics or religion. We often have very heated discussions that lead to both sides getting upset. I'm sad that these discussions so often go this way. I wish it would be possible to discuss these things without them getting angry, or to avoid the subjects altogether. ","I would imagine that I received the award for writing a book, which is a dream of mine. I was able to achieve this by spending a significant period of time writing and editing a book, and then going through the difficult publication process. I imagine that I would feel really excited. I would also be grateful to be recognized for something that I've always wanted to do."
98971,"Well, that would be terrifying. Though I'm naturally a bit critical and analytical, I'm also religious and believe in God, so that would be my reason for this. The purely scientific explanation would be that you've had that person on your mind lately, even without realizing it, and your dream reflected that, while also happening to coincide with their death. Though that's not impossible, I think the nature of the dream and the timing is lined up too well, and I would credit that to God giving me an opportunity to say bye to them, or ""see"" them one last time.","I feel like in some sense I've had this experience before. I don't believe in having past lives, but I think that there are people that naturally click very well together and can act like they've known each other for years. It's my understanding that this is due to a combination of environmental factors and just innate things about the person's personality. For example, you might've been raised with similar backgrounds and have similar interests, but you might also just have a tendency towards a certain type of mindset or sense of humor.","There's a few different examples of could think of, but the first one to come to mind is from an argument with my dad. I'm normally very respectful to my parents, but I came out (as transgender) almost 7 months prior to this event occurring, and he's completely ignored that and only avoids misgendering me when my other parent is around. My family visited for Easter (I am writing this 3 days later), and I finally snapped and started yelling at my dad, for several reasons. He's non-confrontational, so I can tell he just zoned out and didn't listen, but that would be a reason for him to be mad at me. I feel sad about this, and also somewhat angry, but it's something that I've known was coming, so it doesn't surprise me at all.","Ideally, I received the award for a painting I made. Receiving an award for something like visual art is generally less prestigious than something more directly related to academia, but it would mean more to me. I grew up as the ""gifted kid"" and I hardly ever doubted my abilities in subjects like literature and math, but I was a lot of self-conscious about my art. I don't think I'm half bad, but I'm certainly not a prodigy, so receiving an award for it would mean a lot (and hopefully it would also be a scholarship because school is expensive)."
13442,I think that may happen because dreams can sometimes be a combination of things we think of throughout the day. usually people do not die unexpectedly and it is natural to worry about people who are not doing well in health. Or it ma just be a very strange coincidence. ,"I think this would happen with someone I ""click"" with. If I was to meet someone with similar interests, options, humor etc. as me I would feel like I know them because It would bring us closer together because of our personalities.","People are usually angry with me because I am not the best at communicating my thoughts. Many times I have had an Idea and forgot to share it with my siblings and they get mad at me for not letting them know what plans are. I also do not talk about my feelings, so if someone close says something that upsets me I usually just keep it inside until I get over it or they notice something is wrong.","I am not sure what the award would be for, but It may be along the lines of something community-wise, and not academic. If I find someone on campus studying a map I always ask them what they are looking for to see If i can help guide them. I always talk to the workers in the cafeteria and if they are cleaning and there's chairs in the way I try to move them."
37652,"I think that the dream is them communicating with you. I believe in signs from God and from loved ones who have passed. When I was very young my uncle died at 25 years old and, on rare occasions, I've had dreams involving him and I think that is his way of reaching out and letting me know that he's still there. ","I believe that there is a God that has a plan for everyone and if someone has that level of connection based on one interaction, I think that there was a purpose behind it and that they are supposed to be in your life. ","Someone is likely angry with me because I can be very stubborn and don't enjoy changing plans. Sometimes that can be frustrating for other people because it may seem that I am completely unaccommodating and selfish, but it really stems from the fact that I get anxiety when there is a change of plans and I am trying to work on not stressing out so much about it, but something like that takes time. ",I received an award yesterday actually for earning all A's on my German exams this semester. I was able to achieve this by studying thoroughly for each exam and by doing my best to memorize the information that we had been taught. It meant a lot to be recognized for all of the work that I have put in over the course of this semester. 
35626,"I would be devastated and feeling miserable for losing them, of course. But also feel like they wanted to convey that message to me. My rational brain would probably say that it was me telling myself those things rather than them. But still i guess, i would be motivated to go by their words. ","If i feel like i have known them for decades they probably share the same values as me, make me feel calm and comfortable(like home), not judged or generally are warm or caring to me. Having same background or interest also could help. But all these are still based on the time and vibe of the situation.","My parents or my boss being angry with me is the first thing i could think of.
Parents would be angry because i am mot responsible enough. My boss being angry because i didn't perform well in an assessment.
I would feel a lot of guilt and shame for letting them down.",I would probably be awarded for being a a you tuber or social media person. I would be able to achieve the award by being honest and open about my struggles and help people who are going through similar struggles. I would feel happy and satisfied about life. I would also feel like i made my parents proud.
37021,"Although I am not religious, I would say that I am spiritual. Thus, I would think that my dream was really a visit from the far-away loved one. I don't dream about far-away loved ones, so it would be too coincidental for it to not be a visit from the far-away loved one's spirit. The reason why I think they would visit me is because they know I would tell the rest of my family/friends that their spirit communicated with me. ","I actually look out for these interactions. Those are the people I sense that I can trust and be vulnerable around. Although I am not exactly sure how I feel about reincarnation, I like to think that meeting a stranger but feeling like I've known them for decades means that I have met them in a past life. I like to think that the Universe set up that interaction. Like, ""things happen for a reason."" ","They are angry at me because I did something that does not align with the person's expectations. I feel regret because even though I knew they would be mad if I did not meet there expectations/standards, I continued to do it my way. However, I also feel helpless because if I did meet their expectations/standards, they would still be angry and think that I did not do enough. ","I would get an award for having a solid 4.0 this semester! I worked real hard this semester to keep my grades up. At the same time, I was able to balance my school-life with my social-life. Thus, being around my friends has kept me motivated. Plus, I would feel happy for  my hard work being recognized."
73475,"I feel like so many things that happen are unexplainable.  We live on a giant rock floating in the middle of a vast universe so quite frankly, nothing makes sense.  If I would have to guess, I would say it's intuition or possibly how things operate after someone has passed.  For example, perhaps my grandmother wants to give me life wisdom but never could because we could not communicate because of a language barrier and so with her passing, she was able to visit me in my dreams and finally speak to me in a language I understand.","Sometimes I have crazy instances of deja vu and I still have no idea what that means.  I have gotten that sense before and the explanation would be on the tip of my tongue but I just can't explain it.  I would say it's just one of the many things I don't understand about the universe. Maybe I knew that person in a past life, and the simulation glitched to where we have sense we have known each other for so long.","If someone were to be angry with me, it is probably because I can come off cold or uncaring sometimes.  I know this because this actually happened to me before.  I am a pretty reserved person and sometimes I want to be left alone or have time for myself.  I feel sad about it because I care about my friends and family a lot and for someone to believe I don't care for their wellbeing makes me sad, but I also think they need to understand boundaries and that some people just operate differently.","When I imagine receiving an award, I imagine it for being something groundbreaking.  Like I published a research paper or helped start a social justice movement.  I was able to achieve it by being confident enough in myself to not be afraid to initiate change. I feel amazing knowing I am creating a better world for those who will live in it long after me."
82730,This would be so heartbreaking. I think this would happen because their spirit would come visit us in our sleep and remind us that they care for us and are still here for us even though they have passed. The universe has a weird way of this working out and I do think there is a fourth or fifth dimension that we cannot see and this is where spirits/souls are among this earth.,"If I were to meet someone for the first time and it felt like we had known each other for decades, it would definitely feel weird but most likely refreshing. This could have happened because we had similar pasts or experiences that led us to carry ourselves or talk in a certain way that is similar to one another. This could have also happened because they could remind me of a childhood friend. This could have happened because the universe wanted us to be reminded of our past and wanted us to have this interaction.",Maybe my roommate is mad at me for hanging out for other people and not with her. She can sometimes get jealous if i do not spend more time with her and can then project that onto me and make me feel bad about going out and being busy with other people. It makes me feel frustrated that she would be upset about that because no one is entitled to someone's time especially if the friendship is not what it used to be.,"The award I received was for my research that I conduct in Biology. I was able to achieve this by working hard each day in lab and focusing on the protocols at hand, then being able to interpret the data afterwards.

98142,"I think this is a way of God providing us closure as well as peace and comfort. When you lose someone close to you, it is very difficult and having them in your dream can help provide comfort. I am not really sure how to explain how this happens. I do think a spiritual aspect is involved","I think some people just really connect quickly. This is based on each of their personalities, life experiences, sense of humor, emotions, etc. And sometimes people just click and it feels like the universe has brought them together",They might be angry with me because I am late. I tend to be running behind even though I don't want to be. I feel anxious about the situation because I didn't want to be late and it has now inconvenienced someone else.,"I received the award for excellence in patient care. I was able to achieve this by working hard on bedside manners, and going the extra mile for my patients. I would feel honored, but I don't really like attention"
56300,I would feel this was a religious experience.  The fact that the person appeared to me after death would signal to me that there is a higher meaning.  I would also take this advice.  The fact that they communicated it to me would mean that it is extremely important.,If i met someone and it seems that I have known them forever it will likely be because they are similar to one of my current or former friends.  Having someone kind of take the place of another person can so that.  It is not common for this to happen as people are so individualized.  It is more likely to occur when I just me them because they may not be perfectly similar but have similar vibes.,If someone is angry with me it is likely that they wanted me to do something that i did not want to do.  I then preceded to have a bad attitude about it to them.  I do not mind telling people what i think.  I would not feel bad about making someone mad if i feel that I am right.,In high school I was 1st team all conference in basketball. I worked very hard at practice and at home honing my skills.

41944,"The reason why I had a dream about them was because they wanted to say good bye to me. That is probably why I had a dream about them. The reason for this to happen was because they wanted to tell me some things that they didn't say before they died. I sometimes have feelings like that about dreams, believing that it is a symbolization of something. ",I believe that this would be considered a deja vu. I may have met them somewhere in my past life if that exists or I just have a really good vibe with them. Another reason for this could be because we share many interests with each other. It might just feel like we're a carbon copy of each other. ,"The reason why the person is angry with me is probably because I did something wrong or said something that hurt them. It most likely is me saying something really mean. If I'm currently at the moment of it, I'll probably be mad at them too and wouldn't even think that it is my fault. However, after the situation ends, and I have cooled down, I would feel bad and try to apologize for what I have done wrong.

I am ecstatic to get this award, but am not surprised at all because even others that love this genre can never get a reference past me!"
87933,I think this happens because I know i need something for myself to move on and keep going so my brain create this image for me so I can feel like they are still watching over me.,I think this can happen if we are really in sync on conversations that we are having. If I feel a very positive and uplifting feedback I feel like I can be friend with this person immediately.,They are angry with me because I have done something wrong. They are angry because I didn't follow the instructions they provided. I feel stressed and want to find a way out and want to find a solution to solve the problem so they are not angry with me anymore.,I received an award for my academic performance. I was able to achieve what brought me the reward by putting in a lot of effort. I don't know. I think half of me don't think I deserve this but half of me is proud for my accomplishments.

All these factors combined would create the dream described.","The first thing that I would think of if I thought I had known them for decades would be their slight mannerisms in the way they move, talk, and appear. Along with that, I would experience dejavu with the way they interact with their environment. All these factors would probably be representative of people I had known in the past but went my separate ways with decades ago. I would never know the names of these people or the person that I just met would introduce themselves under a different name. I think this may happen if I think of a pleasant experience with someone form long ago before the said meeting of this new person.",I imagine that this person was angry because I did not communicate well with them. That miscommunication caused them to miss other things they were supposed to do.

I would also have made great connections with my fellow employees. I would feel good about getting it but more so that my work made such a great impact.
83608,I think that if you are really close to someone then sometimes you can just get a feeling when something is happening to them. This example seems like one of those times when you just know. If this happened to me I would know that they care for me and feel like the last dream I had of them way almost like getting the chance to say goodbye.,Sometimes I meet people that I feel like I have known for a really long time. I think this happens when we have a lot in common and a mutual sense of understanding. When I meet someone that I get along with and we are interested in similar things it makes me feel like I have known them a lot longer then I really have.,They may be angry with me because I can get very snappy when I am nervous or stressed. I get caught up in my emotions and little things that are not a big deal can sometimes set me off. I have been trying to get better at understanding that they do not mean to upset me and that the way I respond can make someone angry.

65986,I am an atheist so I would not think this happened for any religious reasons. I would expect this to happen because this person was not doing well lately and you dreamed of them because you were thinking of them. This could also result after you find out about their death and your brain tricks you into thinking that you dreamed about them saying goodbye so that you could have some closure. It could also just be a coincidence.,"I think, considering the amount of people in the world, you will meet people that have similar values and upbringings to you and you are able to unconsciously recognize this by similar behaviors and speech patterns. Also some people are more open to friendships than others so if you meet someone who has common experiences or values to you, it is easy to connect with them. This gives you the feeling that you have known each other for a long time. Other factors such as tone of voice and hormones can also make you like the other person more, so if these are similar, you will both instantly feel close to one another. ","They are probably angry at me because I was stressed and spoke to them in an angry tone of voice. It could also be because I am stubborn and like to figure things out by myself. These kinds of situations are hard for me to recognize in the moment because I become triggered and cannot think properly, but afterwards I would feel guilty and likely reach out and explain why I reacted the way I did.","I would probably receive an award for something relating to my work ethic or my kindness towards others. I spend most of my time studying or spending time with friends, so I am very connected to these parts of my life. I would feel happy for a few minutes and then push myself to become more recognized or pursue more awards in order to get validation that I am doing well."
86433,"I think this happens because if it is a person that I am very close to I might often spend time considering what life would be like if they were gone. If it was an older relative like a parent or grandparent I would probably already be having similar dreams like this where I have close conversations with them that I wouldn't normally have. I'm not religious so while it would be strange to wake up and find they have died, I would not see this as an embodiment or their spirit or something coming to say goodbye, but just as a strange coincidence and manifestation of my concern for them at that time.","This happens because we share tastes in media and have many common interests, including ecology, math, and art. It is very easy to talk with them as we share many similar conversational habits and both communicate with our hands a lot and have the same easy-going sense of humor. This rare type of commonality I have with this person leads to an immediate shattering of the usual barrier of friendliness you have with strangers and we seem to skip straight to the type of conversations that best friends have. This has only happened a few times in my life, but these people always turn out to be very significant people for me!","The first thing that comes to mind is my roommate being angry at me for forgetting to do something like take the trash out or do the dishes which unfortunately happens a lot. I'm a very forgetful and lofty person so while I try to be as responsible as possible I often forget to do very basic housework-type things or immediately forget when someone asks me to do something for them (ie. return a borrowed piece of clothing or send notes from class) without several reminders. I'm ashamed about these sorts of things and whenever it gets to a point where someone is angry at me for it, it is definitely very deserved. I feel ashamed for my behavior, angry at myself for not doing what they expect of me, and helpless/defeated that I can't do better at this.","I get an award for being a ""cool sister"" from my younger brother. He gives it to me as a joke/bribe hoping that I do something for him like drive him to his friend's house or help him with his math homework. I think it's funny."

I would take their life wisdom to heart, seeing as in their final hour, they thought of me and chose to impart me with wisdom for the years ahead.","Our lived experiences are so similar, and we've arrived at many of the same conclusions, ideas, and opinions about the world. Or they remind me of someone whom i have known for decades. Though we've just met, our conversations flow like those between longtime friends.","They're angry with me because i didn't keep a promise and lied when confronted about it. I've lost their trust and it won't be easily repaired. I feel terrible, disappointed in myself that i lacked the discipline to avoid this situation.","I received the award for the music I've finally written. It took hours and hours of writing, rewriting, and listening to the same pieces of music for hours on end. I feel proud that i brought this creative endeavor to fruition and it turned out to be a masterpiece as well."
82092,"I would think it was a gift from God to be thinking of them in such a warm way through the night. Do I actually think it was them visiting me in some metaphysical way? No, probably not. But I acknowledge that the event was more than a coincidence and I am grateful for it.","There is an air of authenticity about the person: you feel like you can know their character even without having interacted with them extensively. Perhaps you just have really compatible or similar approaches to life or common life experiences that bond the two of you. I know some people believe in soulmates (even not in the sense of love) and I'm not sure if I do because I have never had this sort of feeling, but I would not be opposed to believing in a spiritual connection between people.","I would like to think that the reason someone is angry with me is not solely my fault as I try to be someone who is kind and mindful of others. However, it is very likely that I did something that frustrated or annoyed someone and then the interaction escalated with a lack of or poor communication. Communication break downs are generally what get me in trouble the most because I am not someone who is very good at turning my thoughts and feelings into words. But if someone is upset, I understand that they have a right to feel that way and though I may want to be defensive, I will work hard to understand the situation to try to work things out if they are willing.","I probably received the award more on accident than on purpose (that is how it has happened with most award I have won). I am likely severely underqualified to be receiving such an award, because whatever I did to earn it was just presented really nicely and I really did not know what was happening when I did it so i feel like I cannot take full credit for the award. I am excited to get the award because I know my family will be proud and it is nice to receive recognition, but ultimately I feel inadequate and nervous the award will bring questions or attention that will reveal me as underqualified."
44147,I think that if this were to happen it would be my best friend from high school who is at Santa Clara University. She has always been there for me throughout all of my struggles. I don't think she would ever leave without at least trying to say goodbye to me. Another reason I think this could be possible is that she has a risky life at school--lots of drugs and partying.,"We have no trouble having a conversation. I am generally interested in getting to know them. I feel comfortable that I can share somewhat private parts of my life with them from the beginning. Overall, it would feel comfortable.",My mom always seems to be angry with me. I think she would be angry with me for not responding fast enough to her texts/calls. Or I didn't do something she asked me to do because I was busy. This would in turn make me upset at her because I still hold resentment towards her over the past.,"I have received an award for receiving all As in my 6 classes last semester. I achieved this through hard work, dedication, and focus all semester in my classes. Spring semester challenged me unlike fall semester so it felt good to have a goal to reach towards. It felt even better to actually attain that goal."
42814,"If this happened, I would start being a lot more spiritual than I currently am. I think this could have something to do with their spirit leaving their body and saying goodbye before they die forever. It is a beautiful concept and it shows how interesting and complex the human body and soul are, but I would be skeptical about the likelihood of this happening in real life. ","I think this could be because we are very similar people who share similar life experiences that make us get along very well. I don't really believe in past lives, but some may say we were best friends in a past life. I think that the feeling of having known someone ages before you met them is a sign that the two of you are meant to be friends and have such similar/compatible personalities that you are able to get along easily. ","If someone is angry with me, it could be for 2 reasons. One could be that I did something wrong, and the other is that they could be projecting their feelings about something else onto me by expressing anger. I am generally a people-pleaser, and hate when people are angry with me. It is not something I experience often, so when someone is angry with me, I feel as though I need to do everything in my power to have them not be angry with me anymore, even though I know that this is not very healthy. ","If I just received an award, it would hopefully be for excelling academically at UNC, in the field of either Business, or Psychology, which are my 2 majors. I have worked very hard during my time at UNC, and it would probably be the countless hours of studying that would result in me getting this award. Receiving this award would make me feel very happy, and proud of myself. I would feel better about my ability to succeed if I knew that it was recognized by something external. "
36848,"I am a truly spiritual person, so I believe that God sends people in dreams as a way of warning and guidance. That loved one is now one of my guardian angels. I also believe that the advise that was given to me in that dream was something that God felt that I needed to better myself as an individual. It is benefical",I think it would happen due to similarities. If you have many similarities with a person it gives you a sense of community. This will also lead you to talk more and delve deeper into your experiences because you know you have someone to relate to. This will make it seem like you've known each other for decades,"Someone is angry with me because they believe that I am being a bad friend. I barely text them back or answer their phone calls. Sometimes it can make me feel bad because I do not intentionally try to be a bad friend, but I like my space at the same time. ","I would receive the reward for best participation. I think I was really good with trying to initiate extra conversation outside of just the questions. I believed that extra conversation would make the conversational enviornment more welcoming. For example, I asked her what part of India her family is from because I have a suite mate who has family from India and she has taken us to visit. "
59126,I believe we are all connected by a greater force inexplicable by science. I think subconsciously there is something greater at work that allows for these events to occur without being in our waking lives. We are all connected.,I think sometimes people just click. The experiences you have are similar and something about them just matches you. You are in sync. I think the two of us would also share high senses of warmth and comfort.,"If someone was angry with me, they might have been angry with me because of something they expected me to do but didn't verbalize which resulted in me doing it. This happened a lot with my dad growing up. I would feel misunderstood and targeted. I would also feel anger at the fact that what was expected was never told to me.","If I were to receive an award, I would like to receive a scholarship to use for college. I was about to achieve the scholarship through my essay writing, and also extracurricular achievements. I feel very grateful to have received the scholarship and a sense of relief as college debt is a big worry of mine."
34519,"I would think that they came into my dream to say goodbye. They might have wanted to leave a last gift by sharing what they have learned in their lifetime so I could have a better/easier life. 
For the 'how' question, I'm not clear what it's asking for.","Maybe this person looks familiar with someone that I already know. Or more likely, I do know this person but I just do not remember who it is. ","My initial thought would be 'did I do something wrong?'
Then I would start to look back at the conversations I had with this person and try to see in a third-person perspective if I really did do something wrong. If I did, I would apologize. If not, I will just ignore the anger coming against me.",Award for working hard. By working hard. I will be proud to be receiving the award since I know I have been putting in my best effort.
26429,"My father has had this experience before and because of this I have had years to draw out my own conclusions. I believe in spirits, traveling souls, ghosts etc. To me, it is all energy. So, I believe that a loved one visiting you in a dream or dream-like state is their spirit visiting you before they either cross over or part from this Earthly realm.","I also believe in past lives. I believe that your soul is capable of having a sort of sensory memory of previous lives. Meeting someone who you feel an uncanny connection with or feel like you know them, could be a past life connection. I also believe in soul tribes, so if you feel connected with an individual, they could be part of your soul tribe as in your soul's/spirit's values are similar. I also believe in soul mates and twin flames, so this connection could also be that. The possibilities are all possible.","If someone is angry at me, it has to be because of something I said or because of my reaction to a situation. I like to choose my words carefully when expressing myself and there are situations where I don't have much time to respond and so what I say and how I behave is too real for someone to handle and they can misinterpret my intentions and feel attacked. I would feel upset at myself for not having better control over myself and I would be hurt that I made someone angry. I also would be forgiving of myself and my actions because my intentions aren't to upset or anger someone. I would also attempt to talk about what made them angry and apologize to them for it.","I received an award for ""Being the Most Loving Person I Know""
I like making a space safer to talk about anything. In those spaces, I offer only love and advice if it is sought. I put myself out there most of the time and have no problem being vulnerable and honest. I feel others see that and it allows them to let their guard down. I would be very grateful to receive such an award and would definitely cry because it would show me that I did make a difference in people's lives."
60325,"Does this count as deja-vu? That's one reason I think it could have happened, but I also think that things happen because you are connected with others on some level. I think that your brain is also tells you things before you process them sometimes. Like if you were missing this person, you would dream of them, and you wouldn't even have known that they passed away until later. ","I think that when you meet someone, there's always some kind of feeling associated with them and this could just be a rare time that you felt like you knew them for a long time. I think that sharing similar interests and having similar experiences and worldviews could definitely contribute. I'm not sure why it would have happened, but I like to believe that everything happens for a reason. Sometimes you meet the right people out of the blue, which is what happened for example with my freshman year neighbor--we're close friends now :)","They are probably angry with me because I'm a flaky person who has problems with commitment. I imagine I backed out on a commitment without telling the person how I was feeling and why, or showed up late to an event because I was operating on my own schedule. I feel guilty about the situation obviously, but also tired because I know myself enough to know that I would let it happen again. I also feel that I could use some help in fixing my habits and mindset. ","I guess I would've received an award for research in psych (funny since this is a psych study) if we're talking serious and not silly...if we were talking silly I'd get the award for being the worst driver. I would imagine that I'd have dedicated many hours and brain cells to my topic (which would be how to best support LGBTQ+ youth in schools) to achieve this award. I think most importantly I would dedicate a lot of heart to it, which I do plan to do since I'm interested in studying psych in grad school. I would feel really proud but also humbled to get an award like this because my parents and my culture are not big believers of mental health or being kind toward LGBTQ+ communities so it would be an opportunity to maybe change that mindset and also reaffirm myself that I have done something good that will benefit others. "
31456,"That would change my life fundementally and make me believe in the existence of the spiritual and the supernatural. I would definitely mark the words of the loved one that was in my dream and carry on my life with that wisdom. And more importantly, my value system would change and I would raise the importance of love in my life. ","It would be in the foreign land, in a bar/ on the street. The reasons I could feel such way are that I either share the same values or the same interests with the said person. Or they are just very accustomed to the way I'm doing things/my habits because that's also how they usually do  them. The latter would make me feel comfortable spending time with the person. the former makes me have a good time chatting with the person.","They are angry with me because we have different lifestyles and ways of approaching the problem. My philosophy of doing things is always to prioritize efficiency when dealing with things but avoid min-maxing people. Some people may not agree with the ways I handle them, that's where I imagine conflicts would emerge.","I would receive an award for the most achieved entrepreneur. I would have achieved it through years of building connections, working for what I love, and putting my mind to it. That would be an very rewarding experience and the award will be a validation of my work, even though it's only a short-term success in the span of my life. "
85107,I think this happens because family ties are very strong. Maybe I was thinking about that loved one and my conscious brought upon that dream. I'm not sure about how this happens but I know for myself that I would take it seriously if it happened to me.,I think this happens because we can share many personal experiences or just have a comfortable aurora that matches one another. I think if you meet someone similar to your personality or characteristics then this could happen. I also think it takes two people to recognize similarities and be willing to be open about them. In the sense that you have to know a little bit about one another to feel like you have known them for decades.,Someone is probably angry with them because I did not respond to their text during an argument about communication. They are probably upset that I fled from the conversation or wasn't open about how I felt or accurately addressed how that other person felt. I would feel a little tired about the situation because I am not so great with my words and putting thoughts into text. I would just want the situation to go away and appease the other person.,If I received an award then it may be for my leadership. I achieved it because I am a part of many student organizations and extracurricular at dental school currently. I would feel very special and joyous having received it. I am a part of organizations because the missions are my interests and not because I want to add them onto a list. Currently I serve as the Vice President for my class and I love this role so much because I get to unite our class and be a voice for them. I enjoy knowing that people can trust me and can see me as someone who can represent them.
49696,"I would think it is actually my family showing their love and saying goodbye one last time. I would not think about why this happens because this is something I actually want to believe in, and this will be a memory that I cherish forever.","it may be because we are in similar circumstances (facing the same issue, working on a problem together ,etc.) and we share some sorts of backgrounds (childhood experience, culture, nationality, education, etc.). Moreover, both of us have to be a bit outgoing to start an active conversation.","They are most likely to be angry with me because I get too judgemental for them not reaching my expectations. It could be for group work at school or at work. I would feel frustrated, upset and somewhat guilty about it because I know this is part of my personality issue and I should have deal with it differently, but as a perfectionist sometimes I also feel very, very sad about the turnouts.","It would be for my academic or professional achievement. It could be because of an academic project I did or the research I did in Communication, and it could also be for my work at the company I'm working for, presumably for building a successful marketing campaign."
92406,"I think this is one of those unique experiences that can't entirely be explained. I follow Buddhist tradition and beliefs so I believe that the universe is existing in harmony with everything inside it and this includes the ""souls"" of people. Through the connections we foster in our life and the inability to explain certain phenomenon, it stands to reason the possibility of two souls finding each other in a different consciousness is fair. This is my understanding of it at least, despite being a rather simple explanation .",I believe in the possibility of reincarnation of souls. I think two (or more) people can be kindred spirits that find each other in lifetime after lifetime. I also think this has to do with the willingness of each person to connect to the other. Looking for moments with other people to have that connection can lead to a lot of these feelings of knowingness.,"I imagined my mom is angry with me about irresponsible spending. This came to mind because it is something that actually happens quite often. I feel incredible guilt about the situation and desperate to fix it, but I have a hard time for some reason. I wish there was a random lottery I could win so I could be financially stable or something.",The first thing that came to mind was an award for outstanding research. It's my goal to study the affects of bilingualism/monolingual-ism on language learning in adults. I eventually want to use this research to develop ESL programs across America. Receiving an award for my research and findings would be a literal dream come true.
57576,"In a dream where a close individuals says I love you with life wisdom, they would be coming to me with advice on how to live my life with purpose and happiness. In the instance they died the previous night, I would believe that their wisdom came from the depths of their experiences and life goals. What they departed with and left me would be almost a stamp of pressure, forcing me to implement their wisdom into my own life. It would be a very crazy dream if this really happened!","If I met someone for the first time and immediately feel at ease, it would be because of similar experiences and backgrounds. Feeling like I knew someone for decades is not easy to come by, but with the right personality and immediate friendship, I do think it would be possible. This would have happened because of running into each other at the right place and right time, and striking up a conversation about our childhood, families, education, and interests/hobbies. For ""why"", we would have simply felt a long-lost connection because of chances.","Imagining someone was angry with me, I would assume it would be because of my actions or some of my words. I can see someone being angry with me because I said something incorrect or offensive. However, I would feel in shock and a little bit offended in this situation. I would also feel upset someone was angry at me and would want to diffuse the situation, such as apologizing or pleaing guilty.","If I had received an award, it would be an academic accomplishment award; I am not creative enough for it to be an invention or artistic piece. I believe I would have been able to achieve this through hard work, dedication, and structure, and not necessarily ingenious ideas and innovation. I would feel escastic and excited, as well as nervous to have my name publicized for receiving the award."
18757,"Our subconscious might have a hunch about their death, and we desire to learn more from them. So, we have a dream about them and their insight. It is also possible that there is some phenomenal connection between me and the far-away loved one. ","As I believe in reincarnation, it is possible that we had known each other in previous lives. It is also possible that person shares similar traits to someone we were close to in the past, so we subconsciously associate the two. ","They may be angry with me for a number of reasons. I could have, either intentionally or unintentionally, hurt them in some way. I could have lacked regard for them. Also, they may be angry due to their own personal issues. Overall, I would feel upset and maybe even culpable for their anger, though that may not always be the case. ","I would receive the award for my research. My hard work, dedication to my research, and collaboration with others would have brought me the award. Additionally, there are other factors not in my control that would have brought me the award. I would attribute receiving the award to both myself, God, and the various people who have helped me in the field. I would be happy receiving the award."
52272,"I think this could happen because we often think about relaxing, warm people and things when we go to sleep. Dreams are often an outcome of what we think close to bedtime, so it would make sense to dream about such a person. More personally, I see this as a way that God gave someone peace about the death of their loved one by allowing them to experience one last interaction with them.
","I think that God sends people in our lives who know us deeply & within a first interaction so that we can have a sense of His presence. God himself knows every hair on our head, every thought we have, etc., but we often spend our time on earth searching to be known and know others, only to sense differences everywhere we go. In interactions where we sense extreme closeness with others, we catch a glimpse of the unity that we all have as children of God.","Someone is angry with me because I did not complete every closing task at work correctly. Even though I have worked a good number of shifts at this point, I am still forgetting small portions of the closing routine. I wish that the manager herself would train me rather than coworkers, and that there was a more succinct way for me to check that all my tasks have been completed at the end of the night.","I received an award for the most athletic female in my study group. I achieved this award for making regular time in my schedule for exercise of a challenging level while also maintaining my other responsibilities such as those of a student and worker. I am thrilled to be receiving this award as it rewards the behind-the-scenes effort I have been putting in in the gym, on the track, etc."
82007,"This is something that has actually happened to my grandmother with a close friend of hers. Her friend came to her that night in a dream to tell her that she was going to pass away and not to worry about her, she was okay with what was happening. The next morning someone called her to let her know, and she responded that she already knew and told them about her dream. I think this has to do with the spirituality my grandmother was raised with in Appalachia, as this is a common for people there to have visits like this. My mother and sister have had similar moments as well, but it hasn't happened to me yet. ","I think this can happen when I have a lot in common with someone I meet. I think it also has to do with if they have open demeanor where they are willing to share information about themselves and be slightly vulnerable. By finding things that you have in common, it builds that sense of knowing them previously and breaks down the wall that some people tend to have when meeting someone for the first time. I'm not sure if there is a spiritual element to when this happens but sometimes it feels like it was meant to be in some way. ","My first instinct is to believe that they are angry with me because I've done something wrong, but my second thought was that I can't control other's emotions and often times when people are angry at me it is due to a lack of communication of their needs or expectations. When someone is angry at me, I usually feel very upset about it because I blame myself, even when the situation may be a lot more complicated than that. I can ruminate on these situations for a while, especially if its someone that I love or respect who is angry at me. ",I likely received the award for academics. I won several academic and leadership related awards in high school and these are what have stuck out to me the most. I achieved those awards through a good amount of hard work but also the privilege to focus on my schoolwork rather than working or caring for family members during my time as a student. I would still feel proud of myself for getting it. 
53359,I think our subconscious recognizes that the person is about to pass soon even if we may not want to consciously admit that to ourselves. We dream of them and the life wisdom they may impart because it is our mind's last effort to provide us with something hopeful and positive before we learn of their passing. I think it makes it hurt a little less when you have those positive dreams before they pass on.,"I have very insane senses of deja vu because of my dreams. I often dream about situations that haven't happened yet but eventually do. I don't know how this happens or why this happens, but this is usually the case when I have this uncanny sense that was described in the prompt. I normally don't recognize that this is why I feel that I've known someone for a long time, though.","Most often I imagine situations that have already happened. Most recently, I had a fight with my boyfriend because I was stressed about exams and I have a tendency to take my stress out on him. He was angry at me because he knows he doesn't deserve to be yelled at it when he hasn't done anything wrong. It makes me feel really bad to know that I've upset him because I have a fear of abandonment, so I apologize profusely and start to cry. ","I received most awards in high school for my academic successes. I prided myself on doing well in my classes and received a lot of gratification for doing well. I achieved my awards by working really hard and it makes me feel proud of myself. School was the one thing that I was good at, so it made me feel good to be acknowledged for my hard work."
40393,"I'm not superstitious and I'll attribute this to a coincidence. It could be because I've been missing them a lot, or it could be a Freudian thing (the figure in the dream actually embodies something else). It's almost certain that I yearn for love and wisdom from that person
    How: probably like the scene in the Simpsons, where Lisa meets the Jazz Man after he died, in the form of a cloud, and they jam together one last time for some good memory.","We meet in some kind of club that promotes sharing of knowledge and stories; through what we share, we find that we have a lot in common. We may hold different opinions on specific things, but since the same logic and thinking patterns govern our minds, we find it a charm to converse and exchange ideas, and we see perfectly why each other have their opinion. What's also important is that we're both the spiritual type of people","They're angry because our personal traits differ and they cannot tolerate mine. It could be triggered by something small, but possibly an aggregation of grudges held from the past. I may feel helpless in such a situation, and I'm not sure how to fix it","The award is for an academic breakthrough that I was able to make. I had an innovative idea, I carried it out in my research, and it worked wonderfully. The award is from some math association (e.g. AMS, the American Mathematics Association) or some charity. I feel happy both for myself and for the advancement of human understanding of math/physics/universe"
66516,This may be a mechanism for grieving. One cannot know exactly when a loved one will pass away. This can leave a person without a chance to fulfill their interaction with their loved one and properly say goodbye. This dream may be a way to fulfill and affirm all of the sentiments the person would have wanted to exchange with their loved one. It is a function of drive reduction.,"This would happen because of traits they share with someone I care for. In the close relationships in my life, there are many defining factors outlining those people. I feel I am quite keen to recognized those factors whether they are tendencies or even mannerisms. If these were to manifest in another person, I would likely feel I have known them for some time.","Someone may be angry with me because I am not on time. While I am very particular about cleanliness, I am not a very neat or organized person. This lack of order can bleed into time management. They would be mad because I was not punctual. I would feel bad because if I am agreeing to meet with someone, I generally respect the person and I would feel as though I am not conveying this.","I received the award for best basketball player listening to pluggnb in woolen gym. I was playing basketball the other day while listening to an evolution of the atlanta hip hop plugg subgenre, which mixes romantic melodies and has been coined ""pluggnb"". I really enjoy this music and I feel like it made my movements and shots smoother on the court. I feel like I was able to achieve this because my specific life path led me to enjoy/pursue this combination of things (liking basketball, enjoying pluggnb, being at UNC). I felt very prideful about receiving this award. "
25535,I believe that this event is kind of a way of this beloved person is saying goodbye to be and maybe they also felt that I was needing a spiritual guide in my daily life in order to make a life changing decision. About the how it happened I think that there is a connection between our material universe and the spiritual one. ,"As a scientist I would state that this kind of feeling is what is typically called rapport and empathy. It is highly probable that this felling is explained by the sense of connection that we may have felt about each other. This is, we were in synchrony ",They are angry with me because I took a selfish decision that may affect them. They got angry because if the fact of no considering them in my decision making process. I feel confused because although this decision is good for me it may not be as good for them. ,The award I received was for a paper recently published in a very prestigious journal. I achieved it with constant effort and hard work and also with my colleges and friends support. I feel happy about it and also fell that I deserve it
33829,"I consider that this dream was a kind of goodbye, even it is not scientific. I probably will be scared first, then try to change my life. I really do not know if the effect will stay for a long time, but I will try.","Probably because she/he has something in common with another person I know, the smell or cloth or something physical. I probably look at her/him and analyze what seems to be similar to another person I know, but not start a conversation.",I do not know why they are angry. If I observe that the situations continues during all the day probably I will go and ask why he/she has this attitude and try to talk and resolve any issue.,"Probably if I receive an award could be because of my career/job, because of the goals I reached i.e. publications, leading teams. I feel recognized for my effort and happy so I will go to celebrate and take a break."
89665,"To me this is a goodbye. The night my mother died, one of my best friends had a dream of her passing her love onto me and my family. It might be a coping mechanism by the living, but it's nice for me to think of it as a farewell act of love. This happens because love is one of the higher bonds in the universe.","I've had a few relationships come close to this. I do believe that some people are meant to meet, and I do believe that someone people meet and stick together. Maybe we live in the same dorm, take the same class, or pass each other every day. Every meeting we have is meant to teach something. We meet the people we most need, we learn from then and then we move on in life. Sometimes they come with, sometimes it's time for us to part.","Probably my dad. My father and I clash frequently; I'm not overjoyed by the way he approaches our really complicated family dynamic, and he's not overjoyed by the way I ignore him now and again. It's upsetting, but it follows an old pattern, one which we are both working towards breaking.","I'm receiving an award for putting the ballroom dance team back together. I've spent significant time returning the team from what was three members to a total of 25, with new people each and every day. I achieved it by knowing my audience, by marketing, learning, time management and delegation. For knowing where to push to get people to go where they're needed. "
20784,"It's obviously not possible that you could know this person died before being informed, but I hesitate to say that an occurrence like this is coincidental. Maybe there were indications that this person was on their deathbed, and the dream is just the mind lingering on that fact. Maybe the deceased was thinking about you so hard that the message was communicated somehow. I couldn't say confidently.","This feeling could be a combination of many things; a sense of familiarity from shared mannerisms, seeing traits of previous friends in a new one, agreement about important topics, or even just shared passions. In general, I think this happens when people are able to connect quickly, through vulnerability and openness.","This person is angry with me because of a mistake I made or a fault of mine. Or maybe this person is angry because of my dishonesty.

I am in distress about the situation, as I don't generally like when people are angry with me. However, if there is nothing that I can do to rectify my mistake, I will try not to dwell on it.

I was able to achieve this award through independent diligence and assistance from those around me. I am delighted that my hard work is being recognized and was meaningful.

Perhaps if they died, they may have been sick and I may have been thinking about them in the back of my head or unconsciously and therefore, they were a part of my dream. I often think about my family before falling asleep therefore I would not be super surprised to find them in my dream world. ","If I met someone and felt that I'd known them for decades, I would imagine that we shared some interests or shared beliefs that connected us. For instance, if I met someone who had the same favorite movies as myself or favorite song that could perhaps create an uncanny sense that I knew them. This could also stem from a more emotional connection. For instance, if we both had grown up in similar ways or in a similar area--this feeling might be produced. Here, specifically, I am thinking about my Jewish upbringing and how I might connect to others who were brought up in that same manner. ","I imagine my friend is angry with me because I have not been straight forward with them about what I want. My passivity is driving them crazy and they wish I would just be clear about what I want. I feel that they have every right to be angry and that I am also angry with myself for not being more honest and straight forward. I was brought up in a private home and therefore I don't always think telling people the truth is the best move, particularly if it will hurt their feelings.  ","In imagining I received an award, I am imagining that I am getting an award from my graduate school department (communication). I am imagining that I am receiving an award for my work to build community in the department. I was able to achieve what brought me the award through my relationships with the many graduate students who make up the department. I generally like most people therefore I connect with all of my fellow students and have close relationships with most of them--and try to foster that community more broadly. I feel great about getting this award because it shows me that my community appreciates the work I do to bring them together and enjoy themselves outside the academic circle."

I was able to achieve the award through my hard work and dedication to the field. I feel accomplish and deserving of the award. And would work harder toward my next one
20041,"I don't mean to sound like a pessimist but I think this sort of thing would just be a coincidence. There isn't any way you can psychically tell if someone passes away, especially in your sleep. However, if they've been suffering for a while, this can definitely impact your thoughts and your dreams (making them show up more often/more prominently). So it makes sense that dreams about an ailing loved one could coincide with their passing.","I think this sort of thing would happen if you meet someone who reminds yourself of either yourself, a close friend, or a mish-mash/platonic ideal of friends that you've formed over the years. Obviously, there are hundreds to thousands of people we'll meet over our lifetimes that we've never met before, but the human personality definitely has some patterns and archetypes that will remind us of ones we already know. It's got to be some sort of cognitive misplacement where you've known that sort of personality for decades despite not knowing the person for decades, and this can lead to rich friendships/general relationships.","If someone is angry with me, I'd imagine I did or said something that upset them. People can definitely be irrationally angry sometimes too but I feel like that comes with a more general feeling of anger rather than one targeted at a particular person. I'd feel shame and guilt for doing something that caused someone to be angry at me but I'd want to have a good conversation with that person to fix my issue, apologize, and ensure it doesn't happen again.","Extrapolating from my normal academic performance, I don't think I'm going to win any academic awards during my undergrad years, but maybe I'll win some honor/award if/when I go back to do grad school. Another possible situation would be an award in a career setting. I'd had to have put in time and effort to get an award, and go above average in my day-to-day life. I'd feel pretty happy; I haven't won a meaningful award in several years and while I don't really care about getting awards in the first place, if I did get one it'd give me a sense of accomplishment and meaning."
46892,"I'm not an extremely religious individual, so I would most likely try and mark it up to chance. Either that or I would try and rationalize if I was thinking about them a lot recently or something that would cause it to subconsciously pop up in my dream. If this were to happen it would cause me to have some reflection and would probably shake up my thoughts just a little on if there is some form of higher being or form of fate.","I would feel as though it is just someone that my personality is extremely in sync with, so that I am comfortable right away with them. I think that normally I'm not the most out going or comfortable around people that I don't know, so it would be something about their personality that makes me feel that way. Since that sense of comfort around new people is so rare I would take that as the same feeling or sense that I've known them for a very long time. ","I would start off being really confused, but it is probably something that I have procrastinated or forgotten about. I would personally feel upset with myself like I let them down. This would transition into seeing what I could do to resolve the situation. I think for a lot of times that people have been upset with me we have been able to find some form of resolution to the problem.","Going off past experience I think if I would win an award it would probably have to do something with my research or work as those are the only things that I have really been in a situation to be nominated for recently. I think that most of the award would be due to luck and the support of those around me and then a small bit of work on my part. I would be extremely surprised, but also really happy as getting even nominated for awards is extremely rare."
15112,"The dream was almost a sign of their passing. I think this happened because my loved one was thinking of me at the time of their death, and that energy was translated to me through the dream. ","I talk to the person and we click right away, we laugh about the same things and share something in common- whether it's a love for travel, the same book, or a similar hobby. I feel comfortable being vulnerable with them about messy parts of my life, and they open up to me in return. ","Someone is angry that I lied about something small to them. I feel guilty because it is something so small that I could've been honest about. Sometimes I just think, 'this story would be more interesting if...' I apologize and promise to be honest in the future. ","I got the award for being a good student-teacher, or a strong supervisor at my work. I was able to achieve what brought me the award because I have good interpersonal communication skills, and find it easy to connect to all people. Therefore my students, or the people that work under me, feel like they can confide and trust me. I feel happy to be recognized for this award, because it has taken a lot of work to sharpen those skills. "
28391,"I believed if this happened it would be an experienced that would change or at least heavily influence my life because it would be the last form of interaction that I had with grandma.

36529,I think this happens because the loved one knows their time is almost up and wants to make sure you are prepared for the rest of your life. I feel like they would want to die knowing you would be okay and that they did everything in their power to help guide them through their life. I think they would also have a desire to see someone meaningful to them before they die. In doing so their last moments would be meaningful to both them and to their loved one.,"I think this would happen if the two individuals were very like-minded. If they have a similar view on life, the same tastes in people, food, fashion, etc, then they would feel very connected almost immediately. I feel like they would be able to talk a lot as well, bouncing information off of each other, feeling like they could have said the same thing that came out of the other's mouth. And this connection would be so powerful due to that connectivity the two people share. ","I feel like they would be angry in I broke their trust. Trust is one of those things that people can get very upset about. If you go behind their back, telling gossip about them, being a bad friend, etc, then they will have immense anger towards you. In this situation, I would feel bad, especially if I know I broke their trust.","I feel like I would receive an award for something like most likely to change lives or most likely to be kind/make someones day a bit bright. It would be something amongst those lines. I think I would be able to achieve what brought me the award. Certain attributes about me, I will carry for a lifetime, and will continuously live them out. I would feel very happy to receive such an award, I would feel honored to be recognized and feel like the award truly matched who I am as a person."
10455,"If this truly ever happens in life, I would have to say there is something spiritual, something up and above the physical world I see. This could mean that people are and can actually be tied in a soul/spiritual/mind etc. level.","This could have happened because we share a lot in common. From childhood to adolescence, and into early adulthood our life probably had many similarities, like similar ""big"" events. On top of this, probably the two of us probably were both good listeners and speakers.","Because the misunderstood something I said. Me being less specific and them being hasty.

67849,"I don't have a good explanation for why we dream what we dream, but as someone who often dreams of death before it occurs, I would like to think it is something that has already been on my mind. For example, if I dream of a grandparent passing away, they were likely hospitalized recently or had an accident of some kind. However, this is not always the case. With the exception of previous events leading to this sudden death or tragedy, I have no other logical explanation for such dreams.","Oftentimes, I think the people we share many commonalities with seem to have known us our whole lives. There are some friends that I immediately connect with because of similar backgrounds or interests. Likewise, I can go years without seeing some friends but still be able to pick up conversation as if we had never parted. ""Easy"" friendships are likely because of things we have in common, even if we'd never crossed paths before.","Someone is angry at me because I over committed myself to multiple endeavors, and I was not able to complete one of them thoroughly. In this situation, I feel embarrassed and like a failure. Obviously I feel very guilty and overwhelmed, possibly even more so than the person I let down. I am extremely tense and will probably remember my failure for a long time.","I received an award for academics. This happened after many years of hard work and struggle, and I feel so accomplished to have reached this point. I put an exorbitant amount of time into studying and preparing for this, and now I feel a sense of relief. Even though the beginning of this journey was not ideal, I still invested a significant amount of time and effort to achieve the goal. "
25523,"I do not believe in the mystical power of thoughts being able to travel from person to person through dreams. However, I believe that if I had any indication that a loved one was nearing the end of their life, my mind could produce a dream about wisdom that I could imagine them imparting on me if they were still here. I think this may happen because the deep relationships we have play an important role in our psyche, influencing our unconscious thoughts and patterns.","If you share an uncanny sense of knowing each other for a long time even when you have just met a person, it could be because this person shares many characteristics and mannerisms of a friend that you have indeed know for decades. Additionally, this person that you just met may have gone through similar life experiences as you and may have a similar perspective/mindset. As a result, talking to them may feel almost like looking in a mirror.","This person is angry with me because I told others something about them that they did not want me to share. They trusted me to keep their personal life confidential but I carelessly gossiped to others without even thinking about how the person may feel. I feel guilty for betraying their trust as a friend. In addition, I feel angry with myself for allowing my impulses to override my better judgement.","I received the award for demonstrating excellent leadership and focus to achieve something significant as an athlete.

37651,"I would undoubtedly feel like these things were connectde and could not really be coincidence. I would still be extremely saddened by the loss but also feel slightly weirded out. this would be confusing for me as I am not a religous person and I do not think it would make me become one, but I would feel the want to communicate to my loved one and the reassurance that they were going to be ok. ","i would think we are similar people. It would be exciting to be with someone that I get along with so well. I would not think much about how it had happened. I might feel that we were meant to meet and it would make me think this person is important, pay more attention to them. However, I do not think I would believe we had actually met before, not that this matters to our present connection. ",they are angry at me because I lied to them. I feel upset and worried about how I could mend this relationship. I feel regret about lying and stupid for not just being upfront and honest.

I do not like when people are angry and don't know what to do,I just received a reward for my efforts working in substance abuse treatment and research. I acheived this through long term research and engagement with the community. I feel proud but ultimately the award is not super important to me. It did not necessarily solve the problems I am hoping to overcome. 
26474,"Maybe there is an unconscious connection between you and the person that causes your brain to dream about them hen they are in their last moments. On the other hand, this seems like something spiritual. It seems as though the person's spirit or soul tried to communicate with you to warn you of the future or of a recent event. The closeness of the relationship you have with that person would make your brain unconsciously think about them in their last moments. Or maybe it was just a coincidence. ","Maybe you did know them, but completely forgot about meeting them. Maybe this was your second time meeting and the reason you do not remember them is because the first interaction was not really that memorable or meaningful. Maybe you knew them through someone, but never really met them, which makes you think you met them because of the amount of information you knew about them. Or, maybe you two have so much in common to the pont where you see yourself as the other person and think you met them before, when really, they are just another version of you.","Someone might be angry with me because I lost my temper on them, or did something to upset or accidentally offend them. Because of the amount of stress I am constantly under, I sometimes easily lose my temper, and usually try to do so when no one is around, but if someone is there, then I might take it out on them because I do not know any other way to get rid of the stressful weight on my shoulders. I would feel absolutely awful because I lost my temper on someone completely innocent, I made them feel horrible about themselves and I wish that upon no one. I am always trying to make sure everyone around me feels safe and comfortable, and losing my anger on them makes me feel like i wronged them and myself.","I received the award for academic achievement, or for successful completing a hard task. I am an extremely hard working person. I pressure myself to try and be the best at everything, so much to the point where I become extremely stressed, or go into a state of panic when I make a mistake or misunderstand something. Getting the award would make me feel relieved and accomplished. That all the stress and anxiety was worth it in the end."
27417,"I don't think I could ever explain why this happens, and I think that's okay. I find that the universe is a mysterious thing, but I take comfort in knowing that I will never understand beautiful moments like the one in the prompt. I haven't had a dream about a family member, but the day i was moving out for college, I had a strong urge to make sure I pet my dog, Lexi, on the head and tell her I love her. I told her goodbye. One week after move in, she passed away. ","This has happened to me, with my significant other. We met in the very beginning of high school. My shy self decided to ask him to hang with my friends and I, and I invited him to a football game. The moment we met, it was as if he had been my closest friend for what felt like forever. We have been best friends for over four years now and nothing has changed. ","If someone is angry with me it is usually because I misinterpreted what they asked of me, therefore I do not complete the task or do it incorrectly. If it is anyone, it would be one of my older siblings or my parents. They get angry because they do not think about what will result from their anger. It is simply an overflow of stress because they did not receive what they asked for. I used to feel really bad when people seemed upset me with me, but lately I have been able to consider the fact that my intentions were good and their reactions are more about themselves than they are about me.","Typical awards for me either have to do with academics or integrity/diplomacy. If I received an award right now, I would hope for it to be for growth, because I feel like I have grown tremendously in so many different aspects of my life over the last year or so. Getting an award for that would be great."
77284,"I think this dream would have been a gift from the universe. That's not to say that this could have been a coincidence, as I've had dreams of living loved ones telling me that they love me. But maybe somehow my body felt that they would die, and wanted to share one last unique experience with them by imparting the wisdom. As in, maybe it was the universe allowing my body to connect with their mind one last time.","I don't really believe in past lives, but I feel like somewhere, our spirits/energies knew each other. I don't think this is knowing each other cognitively, but the energy of living things never die, and is always being recycled. So maybe somehow our spirits have interacted before we were alive. I just think that this has to be much deeper than ""sharing values"" or ""feeling comfortable"" with each other.","Many people tend to tell me that I'm thoughtful and always think through all of my opinions very carefully. So I've had people (especially my parents), suddenly get very angry and upset with me when I say something that I didn't think through very much. However, it's hard to tell if they were angry because I said something not very thoughtful that they also happened to disagree with. I would feel very distraught, and would have a hard time shaking this anger and upset off.","I received the award for taking initiative academically, whether that be through volunteering or applying for something. I suppose I say this because the most important award I've ever won was the UNC Reznick Diversity Grant, which I won for creatively suggesting a study for a nice research topic that would help further our understanding of what connects women through time biologically and socially. I'd like to think that I won this hypothetical award through advocating and working on something similar. I would feel so proud and like I deserved to win the award."
99200,"Albeit metaphysical to some extent, I do believe that there is a connection between all life - and that there is much of life that we do not understand yet, specifically when it comes to sleep. The correlation between the fact that I had a dream about a loved one with the fact that they died could but a result of plain chance, a coincidence, or a result of this fact of connection between all life. To be completely honest, I would be able to believe both of these answers to be a valid conclusion as to why this happened. ","Often times I associate other people with the feelings that they bring me. Over years of being alive I experienced many bundles of feelings whether they be a result of another person's presence or simply a result of solitary rumination. Regardless, I often come to find that people I have an uncanny sense of familiarity with bring me familiar feelings right off the bat of meeting them. I would believe that to be the reason for why this happened.","They were angry with me for letting them down in some way or form. Not in such a way that they are experiencing significant consequences, just in a small, annoying way. They probably asked me to do something small and I forgot about it because I was busy with other things and as a result of that their life is inconvenienced in a minor way. I feel annoyed in part by the fact I brought this situation in existence, upset at myself for not just getting the small thing done, and annoyed at the other person because they are upset at me and that, in itself, is annoying.",I was awarded a high-level scientific award such as the Nobel Prize for my research in artificial intelligence and study of the human brain. The work that would go into receiving this award would have started years prior in college/graduate school where I started applying my knowledge of neuro + computer science to the production of intelligent software. Eventually I would conduct research into human sentience and other cognitive phenomena and apply that research in my production of software to create functional biological models to replace live animal models. I would feel euphoric in the case that I received the award for the recognition of my hard work and achievements.

The fact might come up anytime in my day and I would just start crying and I couldn't stop. I'm an international student here with a 12-hour time difference from my country of origin so waking up and finding my loved one passed away really is something that could actually happen. If it happens, my best guess of why is accidents. My grandma (the mother of my mother) usually is very healthy comparing to other elders in her age.","I would say today's experience with Rachel (my ""partner"" in this research) is a good answer for this question. It feels like I can totally understand their feelings and have grown out of similar experiences. The moment that we started talking I didn't feel too much but soon after we started to answer those questions, I felt likely no one has ever understand me like this before and they are totally cool with it.

63434,"I'm not really sure why or how this could happen, but sometimes our minds just ""know"" that something really important and drastic has happened. It's kinda like a sixth sense of sorts? Maybe there's just some connection that we can't really understand or analyze with just science. Sometimes events like this happen for reasons that could be beyond science, but stating that feels a bit like speculation. I'm not entirely sure what to think.","I think some people just have that natural connection. They might have a lot in common and share similar life experiences. Other times, people just happen to get along very well and ""vibe"" because they have compatible personalities. A lot of the time it's just that feeling of getting along well, and the best explanation for it in my head is just that, it works out that way sometimes! ","I probably did something wrong if someone is angry with me. I might've done something they disliked or there was some sort of miscommunication between us.

However if I feel like I'm not in the wrong, i would also feel a bit of anger.","In this imaginary situation, I've received an award for outstanding academics or something like that. I was able to achieve something like that because of good grades and resources that were able to help me achieve those good scores, like tutoring, mentorship, etc. I feel super proud of myself because I know I've worked hard for the award that I got. I also feel happy because academics are a way I validate self-worth, although I know that can be a bit harmful at times."
74978,"Some sort of weird spatial,quantum entanglement or just souls/spirits being real and being used to communicate beyond the physical.

Maybe they just remind me of someone I have known for a long time.

17877,"My immediate reaction is that the two occurrences are unrelated.  However, in my soul, I feel that this is not merely a coincidence.  I believe in consciousness after death and I believe that there is a way for our loved ones to still communicate with us here.  I believe in God and I feel that there are so many things in day-to-day life that could easily be used to exemplify how there is a higher power and there is a spirit-world.  I think that things happen for reasons that we can't even begin to comprehend because why would we?  Can we truly comprehend how the world began?  Can we truly comprehend the most impossible things that have proved possible?  In short,  I think this happened because it was their time to leave this life and begin a new, and in the process, they were able to tell me they love me in their new form.","If I were to meet someone that I share an uncanny sense with that I feel I have known for decades, I think the only way to explain it would be that we just vibe.  There is an energy, an aura if you will, that surrounds people and I think that when two people meet and those energies match, people just work well together.  It seems very metaphysical to describe it this way, but I can't really think of any other way to describe it.","Although there are various reasons that someone might be angry with me, I think that they would most likely be angered by how obsessive I am about completing tasks a certain way.  For Instance, I MUST wash my hands before I eat anything, so if my friend doesn't wash their hands before they eat I may question them and suggest they do the same.  Even though this thought comes from a personal desire to be clean, my friend could take it as me being bossy or condescending.  This might make them angry.  This would make me feel like a bad person.","I honestly have no idea what I would have received an award for.  Maybe I received this award for impressing the judges at a fiddler convention.  I have won awards for this in the past.  I won these awards because the judges liked what I played and how I played it.  It is not so much technical movements that judges look for, but more of how you play, what you play, and how you present it.  I feel proud to have received this award."

However, I do think it is important to evaluate that dream, and see if there is anything you can learn from it. ","Being raised up in similar environments and having similar values and mindsets brings up similar people. I know when I instantly click with someone, it's because we think about things the same and have similar past experiences. This might be due to coincidence, or maybe people generally are connected and share universal experiences that allow them to relate to others. I think people are generally attracted to others like them, so it's not uncommon to find someone you immediately click with. ","If someone is angry with me, it is probably because I did something to upset them. This may be something that I did or said that offended them, or it might be a mistake I made that had an effect on them. Usually if someone is angry at me, I take the time to try and understand why. If I feel this anger is warranted, I apologize and try to fix whatever I did. If I feel like I am not in the wrong, I will try to explain respectfully why I feel that way.

I think whatever the explanation for how it happened, it was in order to comfort me from their passing.","Maybe we were raised in similar ways and have the same ideals, so we feel like we are meeting another version of ourselves. This would happen because we were destined to meet someone so similar to us. I feel like if this happened this would give me the opportunity to think about how people view me. It would also show how I project my thoughts and ideals.","I think that if someone were angry with me it would be because i said the wrong thing and was not sensitive enough to their feelings.

The other reason might be I have dreamed about someone like her/him, or watched someone liked her/him on tv/film/other media, I just forget the memory of seeing people liked her/him.","They're angry with me probably I wasn't patient with them. Their ego and lack of responsibility might lead them to be angry with me. I would feel that I shouldn't be treated like this, because if someone with authority copied my behavior to them, at least they won't be angry to my face. I want to go away and never need to see them again.","I received this award of being the best new staff in Hollywood internship. I got it because first I have my parents to support me to study abroad, and also perhaps I was the luckiest one who got to learn and practice the most. I would feel proud about myself and also excited to let my parents proud. But I would also feel lost about my future career path because I do miss my home country a lot. To some extent, winning this award might mean another 5 years living in the US alone."
26273,"I believe this happens because they were not ready to go before speaking to you one last time. They had final words to say, so by some divine power, they were allowed to visit you in your dreams to say what they wanted to say. In this way, peace would be able to be bestowed on both you and the newly departed. Although the situation would be sad, having that dream to know they visited you before they died, even if they couldn't see you in person, would help you grief.","I feel like this happens because we have known each other in past lives. If humans reincarnate after they had died, I believe souls that are meant to find each other, will find each other again like in this scenario. In this case, if it is a positive emotion between the two people, they may have reincarnated within the same time in order to meet again and solidify their relationship better than they were able to in their past life.","In this imaginative scenario, my brain immediately went to someone being angry at me for forgetting to do something or doing something incorrectly. Maybe they asked me to do a task they expected me to do correctly, but I simply forgot or I didn't do as well as they expected. In this situation, I just feel mad that they're mad at me. I am frustrated and uncomfortable with the fact that they are angry with me based on their own expectations. However, I don't show anything expressively nor do I say anything.","In this scenario, I have won an academic award. I was able to achieve this award by being the best in my field and having the highest grades. I feel incredibly proud of myself and can't stop smiling. I imagine myself on some stage in front of a crowd, and I don't feel uncomfortable from all the attention and I feel like I deserve it."
14533,"This is happening is because there is an internal connection between me the them. When there is a strong tie, even if they are in different places on the world, they can still feel each other. When there is a mutual care between two people, they can sense each other. ","It might be because we share the same values or feelings with each other. So that when we communicate, we are on the same level, which makes the conversation more engaged. We might be the same type of person if we share a lot of common interests. It might happen is because probably some occasions interest both of us and therefore we both here.","They are angry with me because I did something wrong. They think I can do it well but I failed to do it. So they are disappointed at me. At this moment, I feel guilty and sad because I lost someone's trust. ",This is an award for tennis competition. It might be because I practiced tennis for years and years so that I can beat others in a tennis match. I will feel excited and deserved for this award. I will also be grateful for myself for making so much efforts on doing this job. 
61217,"I think this happens because the strong and solid connection that one feels towards a loved one will always remain. I think if a loved one were to pass and then you had a dream, it shows how close and important loved one's are to our daily lives. Even though we might not always feel loved by them, they will always be with us because of that pre concieved closeness since they are ""family"". I definitely feel that this could occur because of how upset one would be; the death would be the only thing in your thoughts and would, therefore, cause you to dream. ","I think this happen because of common character traits and morals. Also, it could just be because of a strong connection to a stranger and ""it was meant to happen"". Though, more realistically it was due to the connection you felt with the person from the first interaction. It could have occurred because you all share a common experience and have a strong connection from that experience. ",Someone would probably be angry with me because I do not stand up for myself. It has always been a struggle for me to do so and they likely got frustrated either trying to stand up for me or convince me to do that for myself. It always makes me extremely upset when someone is upset with me. It makes the situation worse and I struggle to be happy until the situation is resolved. The weight on my shoulders increases when someone is upset with me.,"I received the award for being a kind friend to anyone who might need it. I was able to achieve this through being raised to be kind and knowing that treating people with kindness is the most valuable character trait one can possess. Further, I feel very excited to get this because empathy is a character trait I value most in myself and in others. Getting this award would feel like a huge accomplishment as my goal in life is to help others and make sure they are happy and treated kindly."
30729,I think this may happen because of religious and or psychic reasons. I am someone who believes in people that can reach out of the ordinary capabilities including being able to dream reality.,"Meeting someone for the first time and having an instant connection is really rare but it has happened to me. I remember starting off the conversation with simple questions like what do you like to eat? what is your favorite color? and it would be the same but then it was questions like where are you from? how is your relationship like with friends, family, significant other? It got us to connect closer and realized we had a lot in common. I think people share an uncanny sense of knowing each other for decades is because of how much you relate to the other person.","My best friend is mad at me for not hanging out or talking to her as much lately.
Me not spending time with her or texting her as often.
I feel sad that she has expressed anger about it and I feel like i should be there for her more.","I received an award for performing a fan dance at a cultural showcase.
I felt really excited and proud of myself along with the feeling of satisfaction and pride when I see the happiness through my parents feeling proud."
65759,"I think if this did happen, it might serve as proof that people have souls that live on past death. Or perhaps that humans have a weird ability to predict the future/when tragedy will strike (kind of like the same way animals know when it will storm, or cats will lay on people who are about to die). Humans have a certain instinct within them.  ","Some people believe in past lives, but I think this is more due to similar life experiences. I think many things can make us feel closer to another person. (i.e. eye contact, shared experiences, shared beliefs about topics, shared sense of style). I think one of the things that might cause this is their physical appearance might seem familiar or even just their presence. I think every person has a ""vibe"" about them and you either match well with that vibe or you don't.  ","It's my mother and she's angry about my sexual orientation. Her religious beliefs led her to be angry with me. She found out by reading text messages on my phone. I feel hurt, betrayed, and incredibly disgusting for simply existing. ","I received the award for helping program AI to recognize gesture language (namely, American Sign Language). I was able to achieve this award by getting an education in computer/information science and working with a team of developers/researchers to make a program that recognizes gesture. I felt proud getting this award. "
61199,I think this happens because that loved person thought of you in their death and wanted to reach out to you. that energy reached you and was translated by your brain into something very meaningful. i think humans try to find meaning in everything and thats not always true idk if they were trying to impart life wisdom maybe they were just trying to hold onto something or tell you a secret they never felt comfortable sharing. what im trying to get at is its probably not about you they are dying its probably about them. they are wanting to say i love you because they want to feel loved in their death. how i think this happens i have no idea but ive experienced things like this that shook me to my core ,I feel like i have known them for decades because we have similar internal struggles and therefore have similar sense of humor. everyone copes with things differently but sometimes you find someone who has the same coping strategies as you and so it feels like they are a mirror of you. you sympathize with them because you kinda know what the inside of their brain is like and how they talk to themselves.  ,someone is angry with me because i wasn't communicating about things that i knew were going to happen or could happen and if i had just warned someone about it everything could have been much easier to deal with. They are angry because i went silent when i could have said something easily and i feel greatly disappointed in myself i saw it all coming and still let it happen ,if i imagine that i just received an award i think it would be because of some research that i did that happened to have an conclusion that really helped people. I was able to achieve it through messing around in the lab making mistakes and knowing that those mistakes were significant. I feel like that is the greatness of life i feel like i really deserve this because i was brave enough to make mistakes and not discount them as just a mistake. I feel invigorated to continue to make mistakes and not judge anyone for theirs 
98096,"I think they happens because we care about people so much and spend so much of our lives thinking about them, that we subconsciously know when they are hurting or upset. Our body triggers us.",I think this happens because there are things in people that you find that make you comfortable and most of the time they are the things that you see in yourself and that is why you are comfortable with them. ,"I think someone would be angry with me because I have a hard time with gauging other people's emotions, I have poor empathy skills. I do not like that they are mad at me but I can most likely understand why. I would like to talk to them about it and try to see what I can do better.","I think I received an award for my honesty. I think honesty goes hand in hand with respect, if you are not honest with someone then you do not respect them enough. I would recievethis award because it is something I try my best to implement into my daily life."
24404,Maybe this happens when two people become so connected that their minds are in sync. One mind is so well acquainted with the other that it can sense when the loved one is in trouble. I don't really have any idea why this happens. ,"He has all the same physical features as I do-brown hair, brown eyes, the same shape in the face. As I talk to him more, we both decide to get genetically tested. It turns out that we are brother and sister, but we did not grow up together. We both decide to confront our parents, who confirm that they gave my lost brother up for adoption. ","Someone is angry with me because I yelled at them for being too noisy. They were opening and slamming doors, and I woke up in the middle of the night to it. Anxious and Angry, I grab my phone and type, ""I am not afraid to call in a noise violation!"" I click the send button and send it to my entire group. All they end up doing is ignoring me and turn on music. ","I achieved the Nobel Peace Prize for not only finding a cure to cancer, but also for implementing institutional reforms that would allow the cure to become more accessible to the public. I achieved this once I became a Nurse Practitioner and opened my own practice to treat patients and do research. I explored myths surrounding whether certain foods like avocados have chemicals that attack cancer cells and by working to overturn a Supreme Court decision that ruled that natural medicine cannot be patented. I feel very proud about getting it, but also guilty about keeping the monetary portion of the award, so I donate it. "
99417,"Think this happens because of fate, and it was destined to happen. As someone who is believes in Christianity, I believe that this is a sign from God. This is a sign of showing love and care, and maybe in someway to answer a question that I am struggling with. ","I think this happens because we share a lot of similarities that are undeniable. This may have happened because it was destined to happen, and it was meant in someway that we will interact and get to know one another. Sometimes I also think that friends around you make friends who are similar to you, so you may meet friends through your friends and they are similar to you.","They might be angry with me because I keep bothering them about the same issue and I can not decide how to deal with it. I feel like they do not know how I completely feel about the issue that I am conflicted in because we have different values. I wish that they can step in my shoe to try to see it from my perspective. If I could explain why I am conflicted better, it would make me feel better and see if they can help me in any other way.","Receive a restaurant award for really good atmosphere, food, customer service. I was able to achieve this through my hard work from a previous job that gave me the funds to pursue something else that I am interested in. I feel great and very happy about it, because that means that my hard work has paid off and people like my restaurant.The decisions I made to get to where I am were not wrong, so it would make me happy as I reflected on the past."
49068,"While I am not religious or superstitious by any means, this sort of experience would definitely leave me second guessing. I usually have fantasy-type dreams and this sort of dream would impose that they are trying to send some sort of message. I would definitely remind myself of the message constantly after their passing as their last words even though it wasn't physically said to me.","I would imagine that the only way I would feel I know them is either one of two things. 1, they resemble a very close friend. So similar, that they not only remind me of them, but could almost be them. 2, me and them are just completely in sync. If I seem to be on the same page as them all the time, I would get the feeling that it would only be possible with someone I've known before and not possibly with a stranger.","If someone were angry with me, I would imagine it would be because I bailed on a plan or am late to some plan. Even though I crave warmth and having strong relationships with others, often times I have too much going on or am very tired and am unable to commit to plans. For example, I was recently late to dinner with a few friends because I was working on an English essay. I would feel terrible and extremely guilty and I would not stop apologizing or would try to make it up some how.","In my head, I imagine a science olympiad (an extracurricular science competition) medal. I competed all throughout middle and high school and it was a big part of my life. I achieved it by working hard, studying, working with coaches, and spending countless hours. I have achieved many science olympiad awards and the feeling is always amazing and I feel so happy and proud of myself to know my hard work has paid off."
81418,"I'm inclined to say that I think it is all a coincidence but I do think there is possibility of phenomenons such as this happening. I know that there are just too many instances of mothers specifically saying that they felt a ""bad"" gut feeling and then instantly knew that their child was in danger and it turns out they were right. I think that this is a similar situation that science just can't explain and may never be ale to explain. I think it could be possible that there is a different dimension or universe out there that is able to facilitate these kinds of experiences between dead and alive people of between people with a connection even if they are far away from each other. ","I think this phenomenon happens when people feel comfortable around each other and just ""click"" when they first meet. This could be because they're bonding already over an awkward situation they're in or because they have many things in common they can talk about. I also think this can happen when one or both of the people just have warm and welcoming personalities that make the other person feel welcome and comfortable to speak their mind.",If someone were to be mad at me right now I think it would probably be because of a miscommunication or lack of communication. I am very aware that I am not a good communicator and I am not good at talking about my feelings with others. this has caused many problems in the past and probably will in the future. I feel terrible about situations like these because I don't like it when people are mad at me and I would never want someone's feelings to be hurt over something as small as a misunderstanding and I wouldn't want my lack of communication to lead to someone thinking that they did something wrong.,"If I were to receive an award right now, it would be for perseverance. I think I am always able to work through tough times and still come out OK on the other end. Even in small things in my life like going to the gym and working out, I think I am good at pushing myself and working through the hard things in order to get the benefits. I think I would feel honored to receive an award because getting recognized for something you did is something everyone enjoys. But specifically for this I think I would feel honored and respected by receiving it because I know all the things I've been through and have been able to persevere through."
72043,"Dreams are a very interesting state of being, where I think things happen beyond our realm of understanding. Your subconcious may know something is going to happen, or maybe a higher being is trying to look out for you and give you closure","While I don't believe in past-lives per say, I do think there is a supernatural being kind of draw towards certain people. Similar personality traits can account for this feeling. It goes deeper than that though- you and the person may have shared similar past experiences that shaped you into who you are when you meet, and that can account for the feeling of knowing them already.","Depending on the person and situation it could absolutely be my fault. A lot of the times I don't filter my words, and I'm less sensitive to the average person. However, a lot of the times conflict arises it is more due to my bluntness regarding something someone else initiated or said first. Depending on the situation I either feel guilt or anger/annoyedness.","If I were to receive an award, chances are it is an academic one, as I have no artistic talent whatsoever. Working hard is not what got me this, as academics usually comes easily to me. Simply doing things- projects, assignments, jobs etc.. puts me on the radar for things. I do not feel signifigantly happy, as I don't feel I truly earned the award."
97797,I think that it is kind of like a premonition or omen that their spirit sends you before they pass on completely.  I have an uncle who had died for 2 hours before being revived and now he has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts and spirits.  This happened to him the night my other uncle died.,I think this means our souls have either met in a past life or that this person is connected to me by a red string of fate or a platonic soulmate.  I actually feel this way with my roommate who I had only met in the past year and we immediately clicked after our first interaction.  It felt like I had known them my whole life.,"If someone is angry at me, I assume it would be something I did that made them angry.  I would feel very guilty and sad if they didn't tell me what they were angry at me for.  Anger scares me if I am on the receiving end of it because I was raised as gymnast and had a bad experience with a French coach who had anger management issues.",My receiving an award would probably be from gymnastics or dance.  I have created and gotten a new skill named after me during my senior debut at my first ever world championships.  I have also won 3rd place that I didn't think I would ever get on an event that I absolutely love.  It is what I considered my best event and I was up against veteran gymnasts.
42507,"I don't have a definite explanation about this moment, as I don't believe in mythical things. However, I believe that there may be some kind of emotional connection of unconscious level of our identity. I experienced this once. At that morning, I couldn't sleep well and woke up much earlier than I supposed to. Then, looking on some messages in my phone, I saw that a life-changing and shocking event happened.","Most likely, we have some common experience or background that helps us to understand each other better and to share our feelings about it knowing the context. Moreover, we probably might have similar interests/tastes and would be willing to share our thoughts with a person who would understand the context. I also believe, that similar character traits or traits we wished our friend to have could help reduce awkwardness. For instance, I would prefer to talk to the person who can be empathetic to me and willing to compromise. Traits that i wouldn't like them to have is egoism, quick irritation and disrespect to other people.
 ","They may be disappointed that I didn't fulfill their expectations, lied to them, or said something offensive. I would also feel angry about myself and try to rebuild their trust by recognizing my mistakes.","I would love to receive a reward for contributing to my community, for instance, through the art. Although I don't paint, I love digital art and would love to learn it. So if I received the award, it would be a certain amount of money and publishing my artwork in some popular media. At that moment, I would feel pride for my hard work and for a final moment of delivering my message to the broad audience.
"
28211,"I think this happens when you don't get closure from a loved one before they die. If you don't get to say final words or ""I love you,"" then they will stay on your mind. Also, maybe there is some sort of intuition that lets you know that they're about to pass away. I really am not sure.","I think this happens because you feel a sense of familiarity when you find things in common with other people. After you speak to someone for a little bit and find out more about them, this feeling can happen. If you find something in common that's important to you, you feel especially understood by that other person. This also might happen because they remind you of someone that you've known for a long time, making you feel like you've known them for decades.","Someone is angry with me because of my lack of communication skills. I acted like I wasn't upset with them because I didn't want to make them more upset. However, withholding why I was upset made them more upset. I feel conflicted in this situation because I don't want to make them more angry, but I also want to communicate and let them know how I feel.","I received the award for being a good volunteer in my community. I was able to achieve this by giving my time to organizations in the area and also organizing my own events. After getting this award, I feel grateful that I have the opportunity to give my time to others. I also feel happy that others are benefiting from my work in the community."
26239,"I do not consider myself particularly spiritual, though I feel like this is an instance that makes me believe that there is a higher connection between life. Coincidences do happen, but something like that is beyond explanation through coincidence. I would see that dream as a message from that person reaching me from wherever their energy/spirit is in the universe. However, I would not see the dream as an omen or sign of them passing.","I think the human experience is very similar in ways that we do not often recognize. We are all struggling and succeeding in some aspect or another without others, especially strangers, being able to see. Meeting someone and instantly ""clicking"" would, to me, seem like a result of the commonalities we have all experienced throughout our lives. Though we are not all the same, we have similarities in the experiences we have had that bind us together.","If someone were angry with me, I would likely chalk it up to me failing them in some way. I am always afraid I am going to fail or hurt people in some way, so I go out of my way to try to always be helping other people. If this person were angry with me, I would feel really anxious and remorseful. I do not like hurting or angering people, so I cry a lot when people get upset with me for something I did, or if they are displacing anger from another source on me. ","I would receive the award for my work as a resident advisor. Most RA awards come about by being outstanding in some aspect and that being recognized by others on staff or residents. I put a lot of ""behind the scenes"" work into my job and I think that is what would lead me to achieve the award as well as the compassion I try to give others. I would feel very seen receiving something like this, as it is at times a difficult and frustrating job that feels like I have little recognition for."
65359,"Like I mentioned in the answer to my first question, I have strongly-held religious beliefs where I fully believe in the power of the Holy Spirit and God to bring peace, joy, hope, and love into our lives. Dreams are incredibly powerful because when people are conscious, they have their shields up (usually), whether or not they realize it. These shields (defensiveness, logic, exhaustion, work, other priorities) can impede that pure connection that naturally flows from our emotions. Humans have a life-force about them (I use religious terminology because that's what makes the most sense to me, but there's a lot of different ways to phrase it) that can be used to do miraculous things, like a dying soul saying farewell.","I've actually had this experience before. I personally am religious, and I do think that God played a large factor, both in the setting and in what happened. Regardless of religious beliefs, I think that this experience was facilitated by a mutual vulnerability and openness to the idea. For us, that was through prayer and song and worship, but I wholeheartedly believe that it could happen in other ways for other people. Genuine connection starts, in my mind, with being open to new experiences and people--there are connections around us every day that we have learned not to reach out and embrace. If we did, they would be there.","I feel guilty. The last time that someone was deeply, powerfully angry with me, it was because I'd made a rather severe mistake that led to quite significant consequences and upheaval in my life. I hate hurting people. When my actions are the cause of someone else's hurt, no one else's anger can cut more deeply than my own guilt and regret.","I imagine I would receive an award for something medical/academic, if I were to receive one. I feel proud, but a little disarmed. Perhaps it's because this vague award is not something I have worked for or hoped to receive, but it doesn't feel fully right or earned. I think I can have a tendency towards ego/pride, and I would hope that that wouldn't overtake the right outcome (if I did earn the award, I'd hope that I was very, very deserving). I'm not sure what I'd have done to earn it--depended on the type of award, but likely work hard for good grades or to train well as a good paramedic."
58080,"I think sometimes our brains have a way of warning us when something bad is going to happen. So, your brain might just of had an unconscious feeling that something bad was going to happen to that person, which is why they visited you in your dream. Or, going a more spiritual route, they were already dead and visited you as an angel.","You get a sense of mutual empathy when you share similar horrible experiences with each other... basically trauma bonding. You probably both met for coffee and then started talking about your lives and realized ""oh my god, we are literally the same person"".

I don't think I've ever actually received an award before, besides for participation. I'm always second best.

54361,"I think that this happens for a reason. I have encountered too many odd scenarios like this to not believe that some greater energy has an effect on this world. Things happen for a reason. So, because the loved one was going to pass away, something compelled them to come to me and share life wisdom. It would have been worse for them to leave this earth without saying goodbye and leaving behind something to continue on in this world.","Like before, everything happens for a reason. You just can't explain it. This has actually happened to me in real life where when I met someone and we bonded very quickly, I kept on having a feeling that they would be around for a long time and be an important figure in my life. Even though I didn't know them very well at first, it felt like we had known each other for so long since we had very similar personalities and understood each other very well. They are still dear to me til this day. So, that gut feeling I had was unexplained, but for a reason.  ","They are angry with me because we are disagreeing on a subject. They are angry because they believe that they are only correct and do not want to hear what I have to say. They see me talking to them as ""talking back"" rather than a simple conversation. I feel upset and frustrated, but not angry because in order for me to still be in the right, I need to stay calm and collected to not heighten the situation.  ",I received the award for being a nice and caring person. I was able to achieve this award by others noticing and appreciating my efforts to be a decent person in the environment we are in together. This award is almost like a superlative where others vote on who receives it. I feel happy about it because someone appreciates my efforts towards being a good person. 
60806,"I feel that there is an out-of-body connection with everyone. You often see in media that when someone is talking about someone else, the other person sneezes, which is a funny example of this connection. I also believe that there is something inexplicable about dreams because they feel larger than life and add complexity to our lives. A possible reason for this could be that their ""spirit"" visits us in their dreams.","I feel like this would happen if we had a lot of things in common. For example, if we had the same traditions during childhood, we would be in-sync. This would also add a sense of belonging to our relationship. Another reason would be that this new person seems very similar to a close friend I had before.","My friend is angry with me because I pointed out a flaw in their actions. They always poke fun at me but when I do it, suddenly they're the victim and I am this bad person. I feel that they should treat others the way they would like to be treated. If you blow fire at someone, expect them to blow fire back.","I recently received an award for being the best mediator in the world. I feel like I am always stuck in the middle of conflicts and have to listen to both sides. For example, two of my close friends in my friend group got into a fight and I had to be the one to stitch this group back together. Most of the times, I resolve this conflict and bring things to what they were before."

75098,"I am unsure why this would happen, it could either be coincidental or perhaps there is some higher power that can control this. This would happen because you have a strong connection with this loved one and they want to see you happy in life. I think this would be devastating initially for me, as my family member dies right after I see them. However, it could be better that they visited me rather than not because we have a connection that will last beyond their life. ",I think this would happen if we had a lot of similar experiences and personalities that gel together. This would be if our conversations flowed and we understood each other more than strangers should. This could happen because we could have been raised in similar ways. I think if we came from similar families and have similar experiences than this could definitely happen. ,"When someone is angry with me, I imagine it is because I did something dishonest. I do not think I hurt them on purpose but I should have been more considerate to how my actions affected them. Or perhaps another reason someone is angry with me is because I am not taking care of myself and they want to see me succeed.

I would be able to achieve this because I have a strong focus on academics and I truly work hard. I feel like my parents brought me to this award, as they raised me to have a focus on academics. I would feel accomplished that I received the award but also happy for my loved ones. "
22497,I think this would happen because it is as if God is allowing them to say their final goodbye before passing. I do believe that everything happens for a reason and that God works in mysterious ways. I think that their spirit would be put on my heart by God because of the suddenness of their passing. I think that it would provide some closure and this is the reason why this would happen. ,"I think the initial connection and similarities in each others lives and experiences could prompt this feeling. People who have similar home towns, childhoods and careers paths tend to connect on a significant level in my experiences. I think our minds find this correlation to make ourselves feel more comfortable with the other person. Thus, prompting the feeling of knowing each other for a long period of time. ",Someone would be angry with me for not giving them my undivided attention. I tend to wander off in my own thoughts or stay locked in on what I am doing instead of listening intently to others very often. They could feel unimportant and worthless. I feel horrible about this now but in the moment I don't tend to see the other person's point of view or feel for them.,I received an award for being the best college student lacrosse coach in the state of North Carolina. I was able to achieve this because of all of the hours and hard work I have put into coaching and all the lives I have touched. I make it a point to connect with my players on a deeper level when coaching and training them. I would feel honored to receive this award. 
30531,"I believe this could happen. Once again, I would take the spiritual approach where God can (and biblical has) communicate through dreams. How you interpret and what you do with that wisdom is up to you. I do believe this happens because either you or they need a chance to say goodbye and I love you.","I think soul mates can be platonic and those people are placed in your life at the times you need them (or they need you) most. Knowing each other does not mean you are the same but you see beyond the surface into their motives, intentions, and hopes. Whether they remind you of someone you knew well (like a sibling or old friend) or some version of yourself, those people are rare and undoubtedly there for a purpose. I believe personally that God plays the part of bringing us together. What we do with that relationship is up to us!",I am not the best with consistent communication and tend to be hyper fixated on the relationships in front of me. I have run into old friendships where people feel as if I am not pursuing them. I would feel bad but also frustrated by the situation. Sometimes people have different needs and wants with a relationship in their lives. I would hope that they know I am a call away and it does not matter how long we've talked; it should just feel as if no time has passed.,"My award I would receive is ""most likely to call in an emergency"" amongst my loved ones. I believe consistently being a resource for people and simply being available can do great things. If I was the first call for someone I would be honored. To know that people feel safe at their lowest with me, means I am a safe, authentic, and loving friend. I would love to have that affirmation."
58523,"I think this could happen when you have an extremely close bond with an individual. With my really close friends, sometimes I can just tell when something bad is happening to them. In this case I think it would be the same, and I would have a dream due to my subconscious sensing that they were in trouble or passing away.","I think this happened because they might remind me of someone I was once very close with. Either this, or they might be very similar to me. This would have created a connection between us. However, I think it is more likely that they remind me of someone from my past, and this causes me to feel as though they are that person, and that I never stopped knowing them.","In my imagination, this person is my dad, and he is angry because I did not do the dishes. He was led to be angry because he was expecting me to do the dishes. I feel annoyed with the situation, because this was always a common occurrence at home. My dad would not say anything but would expect me sometimes to do the dishes, and so when I did not do them he would get mad even though I was not aware I was supposed to do the dishes.","In my imagination, I have received the award for being the top-rated psychiatrist in the state. I was able to achieve the award by working hard throughout college and medical school, and working my way up as a psychiatrist. I feel great about getting it. Being a good psychiatrist has always been my dream, so this makes me feel amazing."
84547,"I think this happens since people want you to remember your last memory with them as positive. They want to remind you that you are loved, and give you what ever wisdom they can that you can use later. I feel like this happens because when you feel a connection with someone you have intuition of what their current state might be.","I think this happens due to the vibe they get off. I have met many people I felt like I connected with instantly, and it felt as if I have knew them all my life. I feel like this happens since I feel a lot of the time we attract either those we need or we attract people whom will teach us a lesson. I feel like this scenario is based of the initial feeling of comfort.","They are anger at me for not spending enough time with them. What led them to being angry with me is that I had a lot going on mentally, and I just wasn't able to put as much effort in as usually. I feel sadden by the situation. I try my best to make everyone happy; however, most of the time it leaves me never making myself happy.",I received an award for easy-talk to. I was able to achieve this award since I love talking to people. I feel excited about getting it; it's nice to know that your presence can bring another comfort.  
30877,"I believe that dreams that involve spirits of loved ones are true visits from that loved one. I am a deeply spiritual person, and I have had a few experiences where that was the case. I don't know why this happens, and I have no explanation for it, other than faith and the profound feelings I have that it was truly that spirit. ","If I met someone for the first time and share the sense that we've known each other for decades, I would see it as a sign from God that serves as a reminder that I am loved, supported, and not alone in my journey. A lot of spiritual people would see this as a sign that they've known that person in a past life, but I'm not so sure I believe in that myself. I have no explanation for how I feel such a deep connection with this person other than my faith that we were meant to connect. Sorry if that sounds stupid.","Someone is angry with me because my mind was elsewhere while they were talking to me about something important to them. They became angry with me after reading nonverbal cues that I was not engaged in the conversation, and my inability to recall what they have just told me. I feel horrible about the situation, and I completely understand their feelings about it.","I received the award for community involvement, and I was able to achieve this through my compassion for others in the community. I feel good about getting it, but still feel like I have a lot more work to do. Getting this award is only a jumping off point for my future projects."
59790,"I think that everything happens for a reason. I would believe that the visit was super important and that it truly had meaning. I would believe that anything that happens is for a reason, and that we should not always question these things because they happen and they cannot be undone. It would be very upsetting to learn this, but positive thoughts and love would be key in this situation.","This might be because we know someone very similar to them, or that they are very similar to ourselves, and we have known ourselves ever since we were born. I think there is also this mutual energy that is being shared in a way that both people are comfortable and truly feel as though they could talk about anything with this person. I think that this could also be because both people are very open and they discover lots of common interests.","I would be very concerned about why they were angry with me, I would be wanting to ask them, and hear them out on why and what caused them to be angry with me. I would want to know this so that I could fix the situation and apologize. It would be beneficial because it would make our relationship stronger so I could work on the things that were bothering them, or that made them angry in the first place. I would feel as though it is important to be calm and to truly hear them out.",I would definitely hope the award would be for academics or for hard work at something. I would think that I would achieve it by this hard work and determination. I would feel very happy and excited if I earned it due to this passion and drive of hard work. I think it would inspire me to push forward and to keep working hard.
75774,"This would probably be their spirit coming back to impart their final goodbyes that the were not able to pass along. This is haunting, but refreshing that they wanted to say goodbye to me. I appreciate it greatly.","This is either a coincidence, a great personality match, or a bond that was meant to be shared. I believe that people meet at the right place and the right time, and our paths are meant to cross and will cross in the time they are meant to.","They are angry with me because of something I might have said or done that upset them that I was not aware of. I am deeply sorry and wish that I could take back that action or those words, even if I wasn't aware that I hurt them. I will probably carry this with me for a while even after they forgive me. I have had this happen to me before.",I received the award for a test score. This award makes me very happy as I have worked toward this for a long time. I feel pleased with myself and my life. I am proud of myself for achieving this goal.
72680,I think that this may happen because people have deeper and sometimes spiritual connection with their loved ones. It is possible for us to subconsciously know that something has happened to someone else and we may see this in our dreams. Their words are likely away for you to have a good parting memory with this person before the pass on. ,I think that we are able to meet people ad it instantly be like we have known them forever because of the connections we form. If we have a deeper and more meaningful connection with someone it plays a very important part in the relationship. My roommate and I have only known each other for a month and we have such a good bond because of our openness with each other and the things we have in common. ,"People typically get angry with me because I have a hard time admitting when I am wrong. Though, I am able to apologize for it later on, in the moment I struggle with not letting my pride get in the way. I even know in the moment that I need to take a step back and calm down in order to see clearly the issue at hand, but it is difficult to take that time to calm down sometimes.","I would say that anytime I have been awarded for something in my life it is typically pertaining to academics, so the award would likely be something like that. I am able to achieve this by working hard and keeping myself on a set schedule for all of my assignments. I believe that having a healthy balance between ""work and play' is a very important aspect of life so it is something I try to uphold. I feel accomplished when things like this are recognized about me because I know that I have put forth  a great about of work for this and it is nice for others to see this too. "
73341,"I am not at all a superstitious person. I would probably think that this was a crazy coincidence, and not read more into it than that.

I don't believe in ghosts, or predictive dreams or anything spooky like that. I think this would be a bizarre statistical anomaly that aligned, or that my dream was maybe influence by a recent interaction with the person.","I would think that we share a lot of similarities, or that they are similar to an old friend of mine, leading to that sense of comfort. I wouldn't think that it was destiny or anything superstitous. I would think that the two of us just have a lot in common. ","I'd imagine maybe my girlfriend could get angry at me, maybe for forgetting to do something important. Maybe it's forgetting an anniversary, forgetting to make dinner reservations, etc.

I'd probably feel embarrassed, frustrated, disappointed with myself for forgetting the important thing, and maybe some reciprocal anger at my girlfriend for being so upset with me. I'd feel like I failed in my role and that I could have done better.","Maybe I received an award for undergraduate teaching. I was nominated by a student for my work in an extracurricular teaching other students. I feel proud, happy, and accomplished. I achieved the award through discipline and focus, committing myself to an activity and sticking to it. The award would be a testament to my determination."
50197,If I dreamed that my Nana visited me and then unexpectedly died the previous night I would assume this would happen because subconsciously I knew she was getting to an age where unexpected death could occur. I really don't know why on that particular night I would have that dream but it could be a way of her spirit making one last effort to say goodbye. I think goodbyes are important for people to have closure and be able to move on after grieving. ,"I think meeting someone and sharing an uncanny sense that you've known each other for decades happens because of the way most people are raised. For example, most people have parents, siblings, go to school, do an extra-curricular, have a passion. Therefore, there is always a basis of connection. I think the odds of meeting someone who has a similar mindset based upon these factors is low, but not impossible. So, it is possible to meet someone and your personalities and experiences coincide so well it feels like you have known each other forever. ","If someone is angry with me it would most likely be because I was not a good friend. For example, if I told my roommate I would come home and hang out with her, but then spend the night at my significant other's. I understand why my roommate would be angry with me in this situation, because it sucks to get your hopes up and be disappointed by someone you really care about. However, I would be apologetic (stemming from feelings of guilt) and work to resolve the anger. ","I just received an aware for my economic research that helps educators and policy makers make decisions to better the economy for individuals. I was able to achieve the award by working hard, asking questions, being organized, and paying close attention to detail. Moreover, I put myself in a position with my colleagues where they would want to recognize this hard work. I would feel proud about receiving this award."
48525,"I wish I knew why this happened. I am not very religious so my only explanation would be that there is some higher power and or humans have a piece of their consciousness that can sense when someone has passed or the connection has faded. They are no longer in sync anymore. I feel that it can be a way to resolve grief because you had the ""final"" moment with them.",I feel like this may have happened because they share traits with a close friend of mine. Another reason this could of occurred is because me and that person share very similar experiences. I find it easy to bond with people who have been through things that I have also encountered before. It creates a bond without having to elaborate; the unspoken connection.,They are angry with me either because I did not get something done that they wanted or because I got hurt by something they said/did and I want to discuss it further. I feel bothered/insecure about the situation because I just want clarification or the idea of someone I care about being upset at me makes me stressed or upset that I am making them more angry. ,"I am receiving the award for being a positive and accomplished women in the business side of healthcare/healthcare consulting. I was able to achieve this award due to me personality (confidence and positivity), my connection with others, and overall hard work. I feel over the moon about getting it. It creates a feeling of pride inside of me and makes me want to share with the people close to me."
35865,"Rationally thinking, if they're a loved one I've probably noticed signs of their declining health by now, and it's probably a coincidence fueled by the fact that I subconsciously knew something was wrong/ they might die soon. I would probably spend a lot of time thinking about the situation and trying to rationalize it and question supernatural factors, but I think ultimately the only way I will ever be able to explain it is with the rational approach I just took. Maybe there is something spiritual or divine governing our lives and occurrences like these, but I think it's unknowable.","I think they probably innately click with my personality or my ""soul"" really well. There's something about them and the way they view the world that matches my outlook on the world and every aspect of myself so completely. This is probably due to shared experiences, biology, life philosophies etc. We are each other's perfect matches in a way, because we have such a connection without having known each other. ",I probably did something wrong or dissapointed them in some way. Or maybe they just perceive that I did something wrong. I probably am wrestling with the want to defend myself and frustration at them as well as guilt and the want to make things right. ,"I received some sort of award for changing the world, maybe in a policy or scientific endeavor. Whatever I'm getting the award for helps other people. I spent a lot of time and used my knowledge and creativity to bring about that change. I'm elated, it feels like I've actually done something significant with my life. "
57713,"I don't consider myself a particularly very religious person but i think that a higher power must have had some role in that, i find it difficult to believe that that could just coincidentally happen the night before their death, I do believe in ghosts and spirits however, so maybe that too.","I think that meeting these people is a part of fate, that its just meant to happen, i haven't personally experienced this but i believe that if i ever were to that it would be destiny that it happened because of the rarity of it ever happening, i don't think many people find someone so similar to them so if they do then it must be written in the stars.","If someone is angry at me I almost always think that i am at fault for it, I know that there are times when people can be angry at others because they've had a bad day or they're in a mood but I cant help but put myself in their shoes, when I am upset for external reasons i don't take my anger out on other people so i cant imagine others doing it either. I imagine i might've said or done something to upset them and I always feel guilty even after apologizing.","I imagine myself receiving an honors award because I've always worked so hard at school, I always strive to get high grades and participate in extracurricular. I feel happy and proud of myself but i also feel contentment because its an indicator that my hard work has actually paid off."
91343,"I don't know why this happens. A similar situation like this has actually happened to me before and I wonder what kind of sick joke God is trying to play on me. But then I began to realize that it's actually the goodbye you always wanted. It might not be the ideal goodbye you would of liked, but it is at least something. ",This has happened because we were able to open up with each other. We were able to talk about our childhood and express our feelings. we were asked deeper questions that really made us think. It created safety and security between us and now we feel like we can talk about almost anything. ,They are angry at me because I didn't communicate well enough with them. They are angry because they feel like I don't put the same energy and effort that they put into me. I feel confused and concerned. I feel confused because I feel like I have done nothing wrong and I am already stressed out as it is trying to make them happy. I feel concerned because I wonder if other people feel this way. ,"I have just received a national championship 1st place medal. Hard work and obsession brought me to this award. I feel relived. I feel relieved because I have endured so much effort, pain, and persistence into this sport and it has finally paid off. I feel like I can do anything and accomplish anything I set my mind to. "
23806,"In my opinion, this might just be coincidence. If they visit you in your dream and they die the same night, then it is just coincidence, not some divine or spiritual intervention. This might also be because their health was suffering, and you were thinking you wanted to have one last conversation with them before they die. This never happened in real life but did in your dream. ","This is because we connect with each other very well. I am someone who feeds off of other people's enthusiasm and charisma. Therefore, if someone is enthusiastic towards me, I will be the same towards them. This is also the case if we share many similarities, such as if we were from the same hometown or similar nationalities. We could connect with each other on a more deeper level than just acquaintances. ","Someone is angry at me because I embarrassed them in front of their friends and family. I was just making a joke, but I did not know that they would feel this way about what I was saying. I tried to apologize to them but they would not accept it or even talk to me. I feel embarrassed as well because of this. ","I received an award for first place at a piano competition. I practiced this piece that tested my limits and abilities on the piano since it was very difficult and impressed the judges. I spent countless hours practicing for this one competition and it felt like all my hard and meticulous practicing has paid off. Not only do I feel overjoyed, I also feel satisfied and confident in my ability to play the piano. My self-esteem is at an all-time high. "
41724,"I think this happens because there is some greater force. Whether you believe in religion or not, I do, I think the world has only so many answers to our questions. In order to explain something like this, I would like to think there's a greater power at play.","I think this happened because we probably had a similar upbringing. If our lives have been similar up to the point of meeting, it would make sense for us to see eye to eye. Interactions like this are effortless and calming because you can just be yourself. With someone you feel like you have known, there's no performance.",They are likely angry at me because I did something that they did not want me to do. I probably felt the need to act on something for personal gain but they asked me not to. I feel like I had to do it because it was the right thing but they don't see that yet. ,"I would like to think I received an award for a contribution of my work to the world, in whatever field I choose. I think the path I am going down now is leading me toward real estate development, so an award for sustainable developments would be great. I think I can achieve this by learning a lot in my early career. I would feel great to be recognized for a contribution or anything I find honorable"
63420,"I think this happens because of the bond experienced between myself and my loved one. When you develop a deep connection with another person you are linked on so many different planes of being where you feel as though you can read that other persons mind. This relative did not actually visit me in my sleep, but I believe they were thinking about me before they died and what they wanted me to know about life. Then because of that deep connection we have my subconscious perhaps felt them passing and imagined what they would want to tell us, or what I would want them to tell me.","I think people can click with each other. If you meet someone who you feel an instant connection with it is most likely due to them complementing your personality in the best way possible. If you feel that spark with someone it would be because your brain recognizes that there is something about them that makes you feel safe and comfortable. This can happen both because your personalities complement each other, and be because there is a certain aspect to their energy that you feel in tune with. ",If someone was angry with me it would probably be because I said the wrong thing to them about something they might have been sensitive about. I often feel like I do not always know the exact right thing to say to someone about something they are dealing with and so I might turn to humor. They might not believe that my attempt at humor was appropriate causing them to be angry with me. I would feel absolutely terrible about the situation where I would remember what it was that I did to make them so angry and make sure I never repeated those actions to anyone.,"I would receive the award for something academic based. It would most likely be the highest grade in a class or the student that shows the most efforts in their studies. I was able to achieve this award because I put a lot of work and effort into all my academic pursuits. I do not enjoy failing academically and try everything not to. I would feel very proud of myself for getting this award, but possibly indifferent as i would wish it was for something I was more passionate about. "
34927,I am not sure to be honest but I would definitely take that information from my dream to heart. I feel like our brain sometimes works in ways that we cannot explain yet. I would hope to remember the dream and would think about it often due to my relative passing that next morning,I would just assume that it is because we have a lot in common and get along well. I do not believe in having a pass life as it is not preached in my religion. So I would want to get to know the person more since we obvious got a long very well. ,"I am not sure why someone would be angry with me. I don't think I have been mean or unjust to anyone recently. But if one was angry with me I would want to diffuse the situation and figure out why they are upset. Then we could talk it out and come to a solution
",I received the award of being accepted into the business school. I worked hard on my studies all throughout my freshman year and did plenty of career related extracurricular activities that made me a competitive applicant. I feel super excited and proud of myself that I will be able to explore a career in something I want to do. 
21973,"I had this experience with my grandfather and this puzzles me every time this comes up. I don't understand how something inside me knew that the next day, he was going to die. I guess it has to do a lot with the circumstances, but if they are in the hospital or really sick, this may contribute to dreams contents. ","Some people have more similarities with each other than in other interactions. When this happens, it makes you feel like you've known each other for longer than you really have. I had this experience with one of my closest friends who I met last year. She and I clicked like we have known each other our entire lives just because we are so similar.  ","Someone is angry at me for not having time to help them with something. I had too much in my schedule to drive them to the grocery store and now they are upset with me. I feel very guilty and apologize profusely, but this doesn't make it up to them. I tell them I will take them next week.","I received the award for some sort of history research thesis. Through my hard work in my major and by applying myself, I was able to do this. I am very proud of myself. Looking back on my actions, I see that I earned this through all my education leading up to the moment.  "
75837,"Maybe there were signs throughout my life that that person was going to die soon, such as other family members fretting over them or a heightened sense of tension in my family. Perhaps those subtle little signs made their way into my dreams. I feel like it's too cheesy to think that I would somehow know just because we are related, even though i haven't seen them in a long time.","Maybe we have had similar life experiences or have had similar upbringings. Maybe a lot of the things that I have experienced they have also experienced, and perhaps such similar life paths brought us to the same place. But also maybe it's the kind of thing where you are so close to someone else that it doesn't feel like there was ever a time before you knew them.","I would feel guilty if the reason they are mad is my fault. If I had done something to make them angry, like if I had teased them too harshly, and maybe they took it personally, i would feel apologetic and try to make them feel better. However, if their anger is unjustified, like if they suddenly stopped talking to me one day with no explanation, I would feel confused and also maybe a little bit guilty as well.","I would get an award for doing some groundbreaking research. I was able to get it through years of dedication to my field and through lots of toiling away in the lab, so I would be proud of myself, and I would feel like all that hard work paid off. I would feel like everything I had done in my life was worth it, but then maybe that feeling would wear off and I would go back to normal."
74765,"Without going into theology, it seems that this is a coincidence, but a rather depressing one at that. Clearly, to dream about them means that they occupy some space in your head and you most likely care deeply about them. I feel that Freud had the right idea here - it often means that there's some negative emotion you feel towards them (often guilt or something similar) and to have that dream is your mind's way of trying to fix that.","While no two people are alike, there can be certain traits, behaviors, or mannerisms that overlap from person to person. Whether you realize it or not, those things can often be found on people, and if enough of them manifest themselves in one person it could seem that you know them, even if you can't individually pick out traits and attribute them to someone you DO know.
..That or reincarnation is real or something - I'm agnostic, I have no idea which (if any) theology rings true.","People being angry with me is an exceptionally difficult situation for me - anxiety things and a rough upbringing, I suppose. I usually assume that they are mad at me and it is my fault, even if it has little to do with me or if I didn't do anything wrong. It could be something I said that upset them even if I didn't mean to do so, or it could be something that ordinarily wouldn't make them upset that I was unaware of. ","Chances are it will have been for some sort of exceptional work I've done, whether at work, in academia, or otherwise. However, I likely wouldn't feel proud of that award as I will likely feel that I do not deserve it - that is, I didn't put the required effort in, or the task wasn't all that difficult. Most of the time, the thought process is ""oh cool, I did a thing.. I guess."""
84456,"I'd believe that it was a coincidence, and that the reason for the dream taking place was either prior knowledge of the loved one's declining health or just thinking about the loved one in general. I think that the unconscious thoughts we have manifest themselves in dreams, and this would be an example of such an event.","I believe this happens when you meet someone you really connect with... there are some personalities that fit really well together, and when those people meet, they can be friends instantly, and it can be like they've known each other forever. I also think that having similar circumstances, like upbringing, hobbies, and other such things, can also elicit this feeling.","I'm imagining my friend being angry with me, for not telling him that I know that another one of our friends likes him. Although I feel bad, I feel justified in my supposed action, since it's not my place to tell him someone else's feelings. I feel like he's less angry at me, and more angry at himself for not realizing himself for so long.","I imagine I've received another award for Model United Nations. After days of debating, I was able to establish myself as the best representative of my country or person, pass the most directives, and make myself deserving of the Best Delegate award. The rush I feel when my name is called in a auditorium of thousands, with hundreds holding their breath, is unparalleled. I smile as I walk to get my award."
12753,"I think this happens because I miss my grandmother and want to see her again. This probably happens because they weren't able to communicate their love and wisdom to me in their last moments since they lived far away. I probably was busy with my own life and didn't take time to reach out to them often. I might be struggling with my studies/work, but the dream brings a comfort to me about my future.",I would probably feel this way if my conversation with the person flowed really smoothly and we shared common interests/passions. This would also probably happen if we both felt really comfortable around each other. Being on the same wavelength in terms of energy and mutual sense of warmth/connection could likely be a reason that I felt I knew this person for a long time. The person would probably make me feel comfortable sharing secrets easily and joking around without much effort.,"They're angry with me because I did something without letting them know before, like taking their clothes or going out without permission. The lack of communication and trust between each other is probably what led them to be angry with me. Since we have a close bond, they are angry that I broke their trust. I would feel somewhat guilty but if it's something they do to me too, I would feel that it's unfair and hypocritical of them to be angry with me when I rarely get as mad at them for the same thing.","I received the award for a noteworthy musical or academic competition. I was able to achieve this by putting in the work, effort, and endurance to practice and study with consistence and strategy for a long period of time.

Either that or this person and I have very similar life experiences and can relate to each other on a much deeper level since we have experienced a lot of the same things. ,"They are probably angry at me over something I did that upset them, or there is another reason that I can't think of. This could have been from a lack of communication, as my communication skills are lacking a lot of the time. I feel very badly about the situation, and I want to do all I can to help remedy the situation. ","I received an award for either music or biological advances. I would like to believe that I received this award for meaningful impact or for outstanding performance. I am feeling really good about receiving this award, and I feel very accomplished. "
61226,"The world works in mysterious ways. Sometimes there are things that happen that are just unexplainable. Maybe it was your subconscious knowing or some other worldly factor. I remember the night before I was leaving for college my childhood dog was giving me a lot of love and attention and constantly cuddling with me. The first morning I woke up in my dorm my mom called me that my dog was missing. It was very unlike her to just leave. Later that day, I found her and she had passed away. I realized that that night she was saying goodbye.",Sometimes there are people you meet for the first time and you just click. There is an unexplainable bond. Often times I think you see qualities in people you know and love in people you don't know at all and when you do you immediately feel comfortable because you identify with that quality from someone else. It is such a cool feeling to feel like you know someone and fundamentally their emotions even though you have only known each other for a short time.,"Someone might be angry with me because I tried to control a situation too much. I would feel frustrated because that was completely not my intention.Growing up having 3 younger siblings, I have always taken care of everyone around me but sometimes I need to let people figure out things for themselves.","I would receive an award for compassion or leadership. I love both. I don't like hyping myself up so even writing this feels a bit weird. I like to think or a strive to help and have empathy for people around me. I have always been that way. That is why I am interested in premed and potentially working in healthcare. In terms of leadership, I have run clubs in the past in high school and I am always taking initiative on group projects."
13682,"I think we dream about things in our life that are stressing us out or that we spend a lot of time thinking about. Perhaps I was concerned about my grandparent's or friend's well being, and it caused me to dream about them. Maybe it would be related to a gut feeling of thinking something's going to happen. I don't think it's like predicting the future in a dream, but I don't think it's complete coincidence either. ","If I meet someone new and have a feeling that we've know each other for a long time, I think that feeling would stem from having a lot in common with each other. It also makes me feel familiar and ""in sync"" with someone when we match each other's energy. I'd also feel like I've known that person for a long time if we openly shared things about ourselves in a friendly way. Maybe we'd find coincidences where we enjoy going to the same places or have mutual friends already. ","I imagine that someone is angry with me about something I said. Perhaps they took my words the wrong way and that caused them to be angry with me. I don't say things to make others intentionally angry at me, so I would feel upset and sad if they were angry with me. I'd want to do what I can to work through the problem and make it up to them.","I might've received an award for an academic accomplishment, perhaps a research breakthrough. I was able to achieve the award because of hard word and dedication to the cause. I'm not one to leave things unfinished, so I spend a lot of time on my research and academics with the motivation of having a successful career in the future. I feel happy and proud of myself for getting recognized for my hard work by getting the award, but I know that can't be the end of my goals so I continue working towards the next best thing. "
43639,"I think this happens because once they passed away, their spirit wanted to send you a final message before it left. It could also be that you somehow felt that they had died through your connection with them. This caused your unconscious to provide you with reassurance that everything would be okay.","I think this happened because we may have known each other in a past life. In that past life, we may have had some sort of connection that carried over into this life. This could mean that they are a platonic soulmate or a soulmate.That may cause a sense of deja vu and feeling as if you've already known each other. ",Someone might be angry with me because I began to argue about what I believed to be right. This could lead them to be angry because I was frustrated with them and had a slight attitude. It could also lead them to be angry because they don't want to admit that they are wrong. This situation makes me feel small because I am getting in trouble for expressing my idea and then being told it was wrong.,"I received an award for my academic achievements because of how hard I worked in my classes and the grades I received. After receiving this award, I felt very accomplished. It made me feel good that people recognized all the hard work I had been completing. It also gave me motivation to continue working hard."
73099,"In a physical, worldy sense of mind, I would say it could be classified as that sixth sense intuition, like a mother would have with their child, or couples would have with each other. However, as a Christian, I would believe that it is a message from that loved one themself, as GOD gave me the opportunity to hear that and feel peace. ","I would attribute this to similar brain wave patterns between us along with a sense of shared experiences. Even though everyone is unique, finding someone like that would mean you found someone who is very similar to you, cognitively and consciously. Being similar in those senses allows you to form a connection with them faster, like you would with a friend you haven't seen in a long time. ","They are angry at me because of something I did to hurt them. I may have done it unknowingly, but I still did it and I have to own up to it. If i did something similar before, it might even lead them to be even more angry with me. I would feel disappointed in myself for messing up again, but I would also feel disappointed in the other person and they would refuse to fix the situation. ","I received the award because of something that I have done or achieved, probably related to academics or possibly even athletics. I would say i was able to receive the award because it was a blessing from GOD. I would say I did have to put in the work to receive the award, but I do believe that because of that GOD decided to bless me. I would feel happy and thankful for receiving the award."
73445,"I think that this happens to a loved one that I knew was getting close to the end of their life. I knew that they would pass soon and my subconscious began to dream about this to help my brain cope with the sadness. I believe that if I was close to them, I would understand what they would want to tell me, or maybe I finally understood something that they told me years ago. This dream is probably to make me feel closer to them and give me one last positive memory before they are truly gone from the world.","I think that this happened completely on accident on a day where nothing seemed to go right for me. I would meet them after something goes wrong for the both of us and we overhear each other complain about our mutual bad luck. We then decide to go get coffee or something similar and get to know each other better. After a while, we notice our similarities and ease of conversation even though we are just strangers, and we decide to continue meeting after this.","They are angry with me because I forgot about something important to them. I tend to write down all of my assignments for a given day, but for some reason I forgot about theirs. They are angry because it seemed to them as if I did not care about them. I feel horrible after standing them up and apologize profusely. In the future I plan on doing small things that I know they love to make it up to them and let them know that I do care about them.","I just received an award for a new or improved scientific discovery that would benefit people's lives. I was able to achieve it after years of hard work on the subject that interested me alongside my team of talented and dedicated co-researchers. I feel proud about this achievement.

26940,"I am personally a pretty spiritual person, so I think I would believe that the dream was sort of an angel dream or just the spirit of the person who died the night before. I think this happens when you die because a sort of spirit or your soul I guess leaves your body. I believe this happens as a final remark to your loved ones before they never see or hear you ever again. It also gives the opportunity for the dead to say one thing they have been thinking for years but never said. ","I have never personally experienced this but maybe this stranger just reminds you of someone from your past or your childhood. If I met a new friend in college and they reminded me of my best friend when I was 5 years old, they would seem almost familiar to me. I think this happens to remind us to check in on our past relationships or just relationships that have diminished slightly over the years. ","I think they could be angry at me for a multitude of things. I try to never intentionally make someone angry, but you never know what may upset someone even if it was just a small comment. Maybe I did not clean up my dishes and my roommates were mad at me for it, rightfully so, I would feel bad at first. After this feeling, I would promise to never leave dirty dishes around again and really try to clean up everytime I was in the kitchen. Sometimes I feel a little attacked when a lot of people say they are angry at me, but with this scenario, I think I would just feel sorry and apologize. ","I would hope that I received the award for my studies or research opportunities completed throughout my major and career passions. I think I would be able to achieve this award by working extremely hard in all of my classes, connecting with my professors, and seeking lots of research/internship opportunities throughout the way. I would feel so relieved that all of my hard work for four years would have paid off.  "
55797,Well I suppose one may think that they visited me before they past because they wanted to share something with me for the last time. In reality I find it to be a coincidence. I would probably take their words form the dream to heart and act like they really did say it but deep down I know I'm just hearing what I want even if it is something they would have said to me.,"Usually if you feel that you know someone for a long time it is because they are similar to you or someone you are extremely close with but you won't be able to place that until much later. I would probably brush it of as a weird feeling and not address it with that person and move forward with my day but think about it often. Maybe if I run into them again I'll think it's a ""sign"" and do something about it.",They're probably angry because I was a little too blunt or let an internal thought slip out that I probably should not have. They're angry because I said something about their younger brother without taking into consideration that he is still their family no matter how I feel about them. I wish he was better but he isn't he's quite horrible and mean. ,"I hopefully received the award for being dedicated to something. This means I have to put in a lot of time and effort into said thing. I will obviously feel relieved when I get it knowing that the time and effort I put in is being recognized and wasn't wasted. Not that I would think it was wasted if I didn't get an award.
"
64325,"I think at some base level everyone in the world is connected in some way. I also think that you having a dream about someone that just died could be happenstance. But, if it wasn't a coincidence, then i guess maybe when you die you could have a few moments to tie up loose ends.","Perhaps they could look like a friend you had when you were a kid. Perhaps you knew them in a past life if those exist. I think the most likely answer is that humans only have so many genes so a lot of people end up looking similar, so they probably just look a lot alike someone you have known for decades. I have seen people who look very similar to people I've known even though i know it isn't them.",I tend to be a pretty condescending person as in my family that is just the way we all talk to each other. Perhaps I said something to someone in a condescending tone which they cared about therefore making me insensitive. I do feel bad and have taken steps to decrease how condescending I am towards people. I would apologize to them and try to mend the relationship.  ,"I achieved getting a 4.0 at UNC. I achieved this award through hard work, and probably cutting out lots of my social life. After achieving this award I would feel proud, but looking back I would wonder whether it was all really worth it."
82545,"I would think that this happened because they wanted to say one last goodbye. It would be hard to explain, but sometimes I think that some people are just connected to one another even in death. I would be pretty happy that I got one last goodbye. I think I would also take this message to heart.","I think this could have happened due to the fact that I maybe met them before in passing or met someone who was similar to them. I would for sure ask if maybe I had met them before, either in a class or having met at some event. I usually can remember a good amount of people who I have met previously. This could mean that I felt connected to them in some way or that we had a really nice conversation. ","If someone is angry at me it could be because of something I did or said. I would say maybe I wasn't thinking all that much into what I was saying so maybe it came out weird or wrong. I know that sometimes I do have trouble with that. I would feel very anxious about the situation, I usually don't like it when someone is angry with me and it gets me pretty on edge. ",If I received an award I would want it to be for something I accomplished. I work hard for my goals so I feel like my hard work and passion would be why I achieved what I did. I would feel pretty happy and excited about receiving an award like that. It would feel like I'm actually making a different in my life.
49048,"Even though I am not a religious person and I think I believe in science, if they just died the previous night and they appeared in my dream, I still will feel that they may just want to say goodbye to me since we can't see each other anymore and I may not have enough time to come back home. I can't explain this situation, but I think it's a good dream. ","This is a true story happened to myself when I was in high school. The teacher who taught me AP Microeconomics is a person that I have this kind of sense for. I think the reasons can be that we have similar personalities, similar hobbies and similar opinions toward a thing. Thus, we even don't need to spend too much time to know each other to keep a good friendship, which can be a reason why we feel that we have known each other for decades.","If someone is angry with me, that person may be one of my parents (my mother maybe). She may be angry with me since we have different opinions regarding one issue and I don't want to listen to her advice and she thinks that what I did was wrong. That issue can be how to dealing with the relationship with others such as my best friends or just a classmate. I will feel very sad when she doesn't agree with me since from my point of view, I think my solution is ""perfect"", and I also will feel that she is not a good listener and isn't respectful to my opinions. ","If I can receive an award, I may want to have an award from the biological field. And it may because I gained some really important or great findings from the experiments in lab. I will feel really satisfied and fulfilled since this kind of award is the one that I want the most since working in the lab is one of the ideal jobs that I want to do in the future. Also, receiving an award means that I am ""successful"" to some extent in this field and it will also let me believe that making efforts is still meaningful. "
27010,"Coming from my perspective as a Christian, i would feel that is God's doing. While psycholgical phenomena/ instances like this are wildly common and can often be chalked up to things like a person's circumstances or their current environment, coincidences like these, espeically regarding sudden, unexpected deaths seem more unique. I would say this happens because of God. I can't necessarily comment on the how of this scenario, even if i did remove the religious aspect of my point of view.","in scenarios when this feeling is present it is often times you and this person either share similar life experiences or similar characteristics. in the past this has happened to me with people who i shared a sense of humor with and he is still the most important person in my life 7 years later. i think this phenomena overall can occur when you have similar values and morals as someone else, and i think personality traits can play a large part in this connection as well. ","they may be angry with me because i am not being an active listener, or i have in some way failed to demonstrate a lack of care or respect. while my intention may not have been negative, i still emotionally impacted said person and it is my thoughtlessness that leads to their anger or more accurately, their hurt. i tend to feel extreme guilt that affects my day-to-day life. especially when the person who is angry at me is someone who i hold to a high regard and they are important in my life, i tend to feel very upset and uneasy. ","i acheived the award for helping some individual or group of people in a significant way. maybe for starting up a program that impacted the lives of children. regardless, the award in related to academia rather than some athletic award. However, i think the award would be related to my leadership. i was able to achieve what brought me the award by the people i love supporting me and by the resources i (hopefully) take advantage of while at UNC. I was able to follow the path God wanted me to be on and He delivered me in that moment. I feel grateful about getting the award, although there's a possibility I'd struggle with feelings of imposter syndrome. "
87649,"I think that is most likely a product of coincidence and not anything regarding them actually speaking to you. However, if I was to experience something like this it would be something that I would carry with me for the rest of my life. When my grandmother died, although I was aware that the final time I saw her would be my last, I had a dream similar to the one described. I summed this up mostly to be my brain trying to cope with the loss of a loved one. ","I think there are people out there that share very similar experiences and life paths as you do and, upon meeting them, can share a very close bond almost immediately. I treasure relationships like this because they do seem very rare to come across. I have a friend from high school who I would consider to have an uncanny sense with. This friendship has brought me so much joy and gotten me places in my life that I never thought possible simply because he could always understand my line of reasoning. ","If someone is angry with me it is probably because I have done a poor job at keeping up with communication with them. I would feel extremely upset about this situation and would like to do everything I can to connect it again, especially if it is a close friend of mine. I have never enjoyed when people are angry or upset with me. I try my best to keep up with all my obligations, but sometimes at the cost of a friendship. ","If I received an award I would want it to be something for character and/or charisma. That sounds extremely narcissistic, but I would much rather achieve something in within the realm of Doctors Without Borders rather than for academia. I would feel elated to win an award such as this. "
46725,"Coincidence, probably. Otherwise, maybe you retroactively changed your memory of the dream when you realized that. The brain loves to feel emotion!","Well, I think that the brain notices similarities due to the fact that lots of people have similar paths in life (because of the structures of our systems). So often it may just be that someone has crossed many of the same systems as you, academia or literature or the like. Also, maybe, it's because you're looking to meet someone new. Maybe looking for new friends. Or maybe, they're just cool.",Likely it would be a miscommunication in language. Language doesn't necessarily represent the world in the same way to different people. Often times we bring in past experiences into language. So I may have said something that the other person thought was rude. I would feel bad an apologize. ,"I just received an award for writing a book. I was able to achieve it by exploring the world, language, and other people. I feel like this is the perfect time to meet other people---with traveling becoming so much easier. I felt recognized, but I don't really care about awards."
26314,"I think this happens because in some ways our  brains are connected, I also beleive in God who can maybe explain things like this. I have had this happen to me multiple times and I can't explain why this happens",I think this happened because people have actually told me when they get to be my friend or get to know me they feel really comfortable and like we have been friends forever. ,"They are angry at me because I told someone something I wasn't supposed to, or meddled in a situaton I wasn't involved with. I feel terrible about it and guilty, I didn't mean it maliciously","I just recieved an award for my company, which is a marketing firm that also helps individuals with Down syndrome get jobs and work experience.  I founded this company, and feel overjoyed and proud. "
63374,"I'm not sure how or why this would have happened. I don't believe in ghosts or an afterlife, and I also don't believe that our dreams have any real meaning. I guess I would conclude that it was all a huge coincidence, that I just happened to have a dream about that loved one on the night that they died. I can't think of any other reasoning. ","I'm a big believer in soulmates. I think there are platonic as well as romantic soulmates and that everyone has many soulmates. So if I were to meet someone who I felt like I had known for decades, I would conclude that they're one of my soulmates. I don't believe that a person will necessarily meet all of their soulmates in their lifetime, so as for the ""why"" did I meet this person, I guess I would just say I was in the right place at the right time. ","If someone is angry with me, they are probably angry because of something I did. Whatever I did to make them angry probably resulted from me experiencing feelings of anger or sadness myself. I would probably feel upset by their anger, especially if I feel like it is unwarranted. When dealing with situations like that, I tend to just sort of shut down and don't really work to solve the issue. ","If I receive an award, it's probably some sort of academic award that I received for my academic performance. I would have had achieved the award through working hard in school, doing well on assignments and exams, and working to thoroughly understand the material. I would feel very good about receiving an academic award, as I work very hard in school and it's nice to have that acknowledged. I don't necessarily need awards, however, to feel good about my efforts. "
96383,"I am raised as a catholic, so my instinct reaction would be that it was the god who sent her to me (or that it was her spirit that dropped by) so I could feel her again. I have no means to explain as to why such things happen in scientific terms, but I also believe that it is through the tie that I established with her (I am imagining my grandmother to be the one). The event that happened to her, in this case death, pulled the tie in such a way that I sense that something had happened to her. . ","We have something in common. I would first speculate something major that happened to us when we were younger such as upbringing. At a deeper level, we share similar perspectives toward world. Apart from common past experience that had a big impact on shaping our personality, we might also have similar taste for relatively surface things such as food, movies, music, fashion, etc. ","They are angry with me because they know I have been distant from them the past week. They think that I got bothered by them being a certain way at one point but I am not talking about it. They are probably angry at how I deal with such situations at times---not talking and pretending that things are ok.

I don't know how to feel about it. I think ultimately it would be ok. The time will help with both of us feeling that there may not be any specific thing that should be resolved through explicit conversations. I just know that it will be ok eventually.

I was able to achieve it due to the work that I put in not just to this specific submission but to many other submissions. I would think that if and when I get any kind of recognition in my work, it would be a result of the sum of my work I put ""towards"" my work in general. I would feel accomplished but that feeling I think will relatively short-lived. I would feel immensely grateful to other people in my circle (e.g., supportive partner, my advisor, colleagues, etc.) and probably the universe (I should say god). I would also feel a bit lucky although I don't entirely believe in luck. "
49909,"Even if it is not a dream, it may just be a feeling that I feel suddenly embraced by their presence through my thoughts. I think this happens because I really missed them and was unable to tell them one last thing that I feel is important. It could also be because I may be going through something that they know and understand (being my ally). Another possibility is that the wisdom might actually be something that I was unable to confront and accept, but them telling me it actually allows me to accept it and move on.","This may happen because of our similarities in interests and our set of values. It could also be because I have known someone that is similar to them and have a lot of memories with that other person. I could have heard a lot about this person, so they feel familiar even though I do not directly know them. They could be the kind of person that I was hoping to meet and vice-versa so it feels that we may know each other.","When people are mostly angry with me, it is usually because I am unable to communicate directly how I feel. These people are usually close to me because I am afraid how they perceive me and the expectations that they have of me. I do not want them to feel disapointed and discouraged regarding the things that I do. I feel frustrated about the situation because I also want to be able to express how I feel.","I was able to achieve the award through constant effort and struggle. When I get an award, I feel accomplished, but I also feel that I must pick up something else to achieve now that I have succeeded in this. The award may be something achieved with teamwork, which allows me to work more with that specific person because I know that we make a good team. I could also feel tired because sometimes I am no longer interested in what drove me to achieve the award in the first place."

Spiritual energy is one of those types of energies, and I feel that the occurrence stated above is just manifestation of spiritual energy through the focus of the love two people can share.  ","Again, I think that it is plausible that not only matter gets reused when a person is deceased, but their spiritual energy can repopulate another organism as well. In the situation above, it seems that both myself and the person I have encountered have spiritual energies that were intertwined in some way in the past. ","They are angry with me because sometimes I am hard-headed and stubborn. When my engine gets running I have a difficult time understanding and visualizing other viewpoints and ideas. At the time, I probably feel indignant that I am in the right, however, afterwards I am sorry and feel terrible about the entire encounter.

21016,"There are actually many theories on why we dream such as for wish fulfillment, emotional processing, and sorting through events of the day. I think this dream would occur from one's personal desire for love and affection. This desire can stem from a lack of such attention and love in your life. It also can stem from the recent loss of a loved one.","This immediate connection would occur from having a similar background and upbringing. For instance, if both of you went to an all boys high school and grew up in a youth group, then you are going to have similar experiences. You will take about these nearly shared experiences and begin to just think they had the same experiences as you.

Maybe he died from a heart attack, or just by accidentally falling off the stairs while trying to walk upstairs. In any case, if such a coincidence occurs - that he dies the night before my dream - I would say it is destined by a divine being to let us have one last conversation through my dream. I share a lot of memories with my grandfather. As such, meeting him through my dream one last time is the most blessed thing that could have happened to me. ","It is probably because we share the same hobbies and viewpoints on certain aspects of life. This could have happened by us accidentally meeting each other in an environment that each of us frequently visits, such as a gym or a social club. I would get along with someone easily if they are open-minded and non-judgemental. These could make me feel that I have known the other person for a long time since we share so much in common with one another.","They are probably angry with me because I did not feel the same way that they do about a certain topic. I tend to be very argumentative in issues that I feel strongly about and would express it openly. As such, it is not easy for others to persuade me to think in their perspectives about certain things, which can be a source of confrontation. If the other person is also not agreeable, there's a high chance that both of us would be angry at each other. ","I probably received an award for being the hardest worker for the task. Although I am not always the quickest in solving problems, my work ethic can compensate for that.

Sometimes I kind of shut people out randomly for no apparent reason. it would make sense that they are angry with me because they probably think i don't care about them whihc usually isn't the truth. For some reason i tend to not put effort in some things and it hurts my relationships sometimes. I feel a bit angry at myself at times when i do this because the other person doesn't deserve that.,I recieved an award for being a great handball player.

Sometimes I hurt others' feelings and dont realize it till after the fact. I like to say Im good at reading people, but im not perfect and sometimes make people upset. I feel guilty for upsetting them and dont want it to happen ever again.","Oh wow, I got an award for doing research on proteins! I received the award because the research I did was relevant to the medical field. I was able to achieve this due to mentoring and support I have recieved from my family, friends, and professors. I feel so blessed that I an able to do what I love and help humanity at the same time."
35198,"It was God's message. I believe that it was the spirit of my loved one giving me a last goodbye and send off before they died because they love me so much. My dad had a dream of his mother before she died, so I believe that. I believe God connected us together in spirit.",This could be a deja vu moment. Why I think this happened is because maybe it was fate. I feel that somethings happen for a reason and we get a learning experience out of it. There have been events in my life that have led me to greater things and led me to meet new people.  ,"They maybe angry with me because I'm in my own world a lot of the time and forget about what's around me. I probably have had to cancel plans or don't reach out because i'm hyper focus on a few things. I feel bad about the situation because i care about the person, but not sure how to communicate. I want to improve. ",I honestly not sure why I received the award. I can't really think of something that would be worth getting an award for. I would feel surprised. I can't come up with anything else.
29109,"I would not be able to explain why this happened. I am very superstitious about things like that and trying to put a meaning to them, and the only thing I could think of is that we had a really strong emotional connection. However, I logically could never understand why it happened.   ","I would think that I knew them from somewhere but just could not place them. I would assume that they were around me when I was a child or they looked like someone I knew. It would bother me until I figured out where I knew them from, but if we really have no prior knowledge of each other, I would assume it is a coincidence. ","I most likely annoyed them or did something they did not approve of, which I feel like happens often. I would feel like I was not doing anything wrong until I noticed they were mad at me, then I would watch every move that I make and try my best to stay out of their way. I would feel ashamed of myself for making someone upset. ","The first situation I thought of was an academic award for having a high GPA or something of that nature. I would have studied hard and focused on school like I do now, and receiving the reward would make me feel like my hard work paid off. However, I would still feel like someone better should have gotten it or that it was not that big of an accomplishment. "
55758,"I think this is a sign from the universe that this person wants to see me through into the next chapter of my life. Though I am not religious, I believe everything happens for a reason and there is a certain order to the universe. This dream, a reflection of my subconscious, is demonstrating my innermost desires. There is some energy that wants my loved one to visit and impact me. ","I feel that certain connections can be formed in an instant. When you share certain beliefs and passions with someone, it can form a strong bond that can bring you together quickly. When you share aspects of your identity with someone, it can be a unifying factor and make for incredibly strong friendships. This sense of deja vu is an accompaniment to your inner emotions. ",The individual is most likely angry at me because I said or did something without thinking through the consequences. I find myself jumping to actions quickly without taking time to think through what they will lead to. I do not like when people are angry with me and feel very insecure when this occurs. I will do my best to reconcile with them and take accountability. ,"I likely received an award for leadership in either a project involving activism or a scientific discipline. One of my main goals in life is to be a leader, and I feel I will eventually achieve this and impact the greater community. I feel proud of myself for overcoming many obstacles as queer woman in STEM, raised as a military brat, facing depression/anxiety/OCD to make it. By making an impact, I have achieved my purpose in life. "
56150,I think that if the connection between yourself and a family member is strong you can know if something is going wrong. I've heard multiple stories of a mother or sister knowing when their child is in pain and I think this is similar. I don't really believe that the person who died came and talked to you during your dream after they died. I think it might just be coincidence or if you knew they were sick or old.,"I think that you can feel very comfortable with someone very quickly if they remind you of someone else in your life. It could be someone you haven't seen in a while and this new person reminds you of them. however, I don;t think that it means you have met them before.",Someone is angry with me because I didn't tell them the entire truth. I tend to leave parts of stories out that may be relevant and when someone finds out about something I didn't tell them they get angry. I feel bad about the situation but at the same time I'm not required to tell someone every detail about everything.,I received an award for winning a competition. In order to get the award I practiced many times and competed before this competition. I feel very happy and successful that I got the reward. I feel like I earned it and deserve to celebrate it.
39808,"I can't really imagine this kind of things happening on me. But to be honest, it happened to me once. The night my grandfather passed away, I was still a 3 year old infant sleeping on the bed. And my mother told me that I told her, while I was dreaming, my grandfather smiled at me and touched my face. This sounds miraculous, and I really can't think of any reason why this would happen. The deep connection between my family and I might lead to this? I don't know. ","I never had such kind of feelings to be honest. But I heard a lot about this kind of feelings from books, tvs, etc. I believe there is an after life for every one of us. Doing good things in this life, will result in goodness in next life. So perhaps the ""others"" are really one of my friends I met for decades in the last life. Or from a more realistic perspective, I would say our hobbies, conversations, the way we speak and react to things is very similar.","For me, the first thought is my mom was being angry at me when I was small. She is being angry because I did something disappointing to her. And I failed to meet her expectation. My mom is much different from the one she was before. She is kind, agreeable and wise. But I still can remember the feelings of the shame and sadness back in the days. ","I receive the award for helping other people. I have a dream of being a world class philanthropist, and to bring warmth to other people around me. I donated more than 40000 books and thousands of clothes to rural schools and orphanages in China. I feel accomplished, motivated, fulfilled, and happy about getting the award and able to help other people. "
40239,"I think this could be because we may have been noticing signs that she was going to die soon, so our mind is mentally preparing us to handle what comes from this.  She may be sick or ill or anything along the lines of this.  In this chance that this is not the case it is just an extreme coincidence that this event occurs.  I feel like everything in life happens for a reason though and that's why something like this would occur. ","I think this happens for a multitude of reasons.  For starters, I feel that there are people all around the world who may remind us of our friends, family, etc., and that can cause us to feel like we've known them forever.  I also think that some people may remind us of ourselves and share similar life experiences that we do, which can also create this sense of knowing someone else for a long time. ","Someone may be angry with me because they envy my personality or ability to speak to others.  I am an extremely kind and easy going person, and not everyone likes that.  I usually make friends easily wherever I go, which can lead to some people being mad.  I do not feel angry back or share the emotion they feel towards me, because at the end of the day I can't control any people besides myself. ","I have just received an award for leadership.  I was able to achieve what brought me the award by being kind to everyone and making sure that everyone I interacted with felt that they had an entire purpose to be there.  I feel extremely honored to receive this award, I feel that is speaks greatly to my character and who I am as a person."
84674,I'm not entirely sure as to why this happened--there could be a multitude of explanations depending on the person. It may be coincidental or simply because that person had been on someone's mind. ,I think this happened because we share a lot in common or have similar backgrounds/upbringings. I'll feel I've known someone forever if they express or communicate something that I had only felt like I knew about or experienced.,A person would be angry that I didn't follow up with them or take the time to respond in a super timely manner. I would feel guilty for not setting aside time to fully focus my attention on responding to a text or specific email. ,I won an award for showing leadership in my campus ministry. I achieved it by taking initiative in coordinating and planning events for my fellow PCM'ers (members of the campus ministry). I'd feel really proud of myself for the hard work and commitment I have put into the organization. 
88691,"I can't think of a logical, or scientific explanation for this scenario. When you become exceptionally close with someone, it's almost like there's a sense of togetherness and a feeling of being in sync even when you are far apart. I'm kind of at a loss for words for answering this question.  ","This is likely because of having similar interests/backgrounds. I've found that in my life, shared experiences and feelings tend to initiate my friendships and relationships. I also think that in this situation, the energy put into the conversations/connections were reciprocated by both me and the individual I was meeting. ","I am a person that is very easygoing, and I tend to avoid conflict if at all possible. I also tend to be the first to apologize and take the blame in these kinds of situations. If someone were to be angry at me, I would start my reflecting on my actions and behaviors, and communicating with them to see if I harmed them in any way. If not I would attempt to communicate my perspective. I would probably be relatively uncomfortable in this situation. ","If I were to receive an award, I think that it would be for the effort I put into music education. I was able to earn the reward because of the musical mentors that I've had in the past, and because of the effort I put in to impact the lives of others through art. In all honesty, I feel awkward writing this because I have trouble celebrating my accomplishments, but I think that if I were to receive an award like this, I would feel very grateful. "
60956,"I think there is some connection between what you dream and what happens in reality; It could definitely be some kind of regret that something isn't fulfilled in reality that got into your dreams. It would be a really sad situation but at the same time something would be fulfilled and are meant to be. For example, you at least got to ""say"" goodbye and listen to your loved-one. ","I think some people share similarities in personality and values; Or, this person might be very similar to someone that I know from before but have not seen for a while. They know what you are thinking and they know what you want to do; Some people know they can be the best friends since they meet. ","They are angry with me because I didn't take them seriously. I imagine someone tell me about their misfortunes but I didn't reply, or I just say they're okay. I sometimes tend to do that because you can't really tell how bad the situation the other is experiencing. I will probably feel bad if I know they are really not happy and experiencing something worse than I thought. ",I got an award for oscar's best actor. I played an important role in a movie about family; I worked really hard and immersed myself in that role; I think that getting the award recognizes my passion about acting. 
79470,There would have to be a higher-power acting because that is too much of a coincidence.I think that God would have done this to me to give me peace over their passing. I would also believe that it was actually them or their spirit in the dream. Sometimes God will try to help us with grief and overcoming those dark places. ,Some people in society share similar experiences or personality traits which makes it more likely for them to bond. Sometimes it has nothing to do with that and you just click. Compatibility and circumstance can often influence how you form an impression of someone which may lead to a connection. there are a lot of factors involved in the paths that God puts us on.,"I probably did/said something wrong, probably politically or made a joke, that they either took the wrong way or were offended by. I often say things without thinking. I get very nervous and worried about people being angry at me for saying or doing stupid things. I also put a lot of pressure on myself to get things right and make others comfortable so I will probably fall into self-loathing.",Probably an academic award. I would have worked hard to understand and apply my academic material. I would feel good about myself for achieving it when I had put a lot of work in. But I always know that that feeling fades as I look towards the next accolade. 
35567,"I think that this may have happened because it is possible that this loved one had been sick for a while. You may have been subconsciously thinking about the loved ones health for a while. It could even be that they were in extremely bad conditions the day before. At times, dreaming consists of thoughts that we have suppressed or that are lingering on our mind. If not, and the individual was perfectly healthy, this may just be a miracle beyond my understanding.","This may have happened because you are very similar. You may share similar interests, ages, and have a similar personality, or one that compliments the other. Sometimes people are extremely open an easy to talk to. Many times these individuals become your closest friends. Also, some individuals have personality types that resemble those of your own loved ones and closest friends. ","They may be angry with me about my lack of communication. This lack of communication may have been from me getting caught up in stressful tasks such as school work and other activities that take up my time. I have a tendency to almost forget to reply to others over the phone and at times forget how this makes them feel. I feel that even though it hurts to admit, I often let my emotions block my communication with others and it is something that I should work towards.","I most likely received an award for community service or academics. I would guess that I participated in a charity or community service organization n and raised a certain amount of money or made some kind of long lasting change to a group of people. I feel appreciated and thankful that my efforts were recognized, but also just happy that my efforts may have been able to help a certain group. The award itself doesn't truly mean that much alone. "
89992,"I think this happens as a result of some unconscious desire to spend more time with a loved one you managed to know passed away. Maybe there is some spiritual factor that is involved. For example, perhaps your loved one's spirit was able to get in touch with everyone they loved that lived nearby, and you were the only one left. The spirit managed to visit you and help you one last time. ","I think that this is a result of two people's vibes just getting along really well. If an instant connection is made between two people, especially if they share very similar personalities, I think it's easier for them to learn more about each other and continue their conversation. Maybe this happened because each person reminds the other of a close friend or family member they've known for a long time. This could also be spiritually related--maybe they knew each other in past lives. ","One of my friends is angry with me because I accidentally stood them up. We planned to meet up for lunch, but I was so preoccupied with other tasks that I forgot. They are especially mad because I promised them. I feel very apologetic and wish that I could turn back time.","I just received an award that we won the national championship for club water polo. I, along with my team, was able to achieve this by consistently showing up to practice and working hard. We also enjoyed each others' company which helped boost team chemistry and communication. I feel extremely excited and proud."
68324,"I think this happens because we are all connected in some way. Once you meet someone, it is really easy to stay connected to them for a very very long time. If they made a major impact on your life, it's not surprising that this happens. I think this can happen because of some unknown metaphysical thing that is between all humans that hasn't been discovered yet.","If I meet someone for the first time and it feels like I've known them forever, it is probably because we have similar life experiences. I think this could happen because my life isn't particularly unique. This would happen very randomly and unexpectedly. Through conversation, this feeling would grow stronger and be known to both of us hopefully.","If someone is angry with me, it is probably to do with my carelessness or lack of discipline. What led them to be angry is probably me losing something important or me completely forgetting about an event or an important task I needed to complete.. I feel really bad about this because though I tend to be careless, it isn't intentional. I do want to change this behavior.",I probably received the award for being the most engaged and proactive person in whatever organization the award is for. I was able to achieve this award through being proactive in my actions within the organization. I tend to put my everything and full effort when I join an organization. I feel good about receiving this reward because it makes me feel like my actions are seen and appreciated.
68324,"I think this happens because we are all somehow indirectly connected with one another through an unknown connection that isn't exactly obvious at first glance. In some metaphysical way, you are connected to your loved one which allows them to contact you once last time through your self conscious. I don't think the exact means for why this happens has been discovered yet. I believe that once it is discovered, it will be much clearer exactly how this happens.","I think this happens because we all have experienced similar emotions, feelings, and situations. A lot of experiences and emotions can be shared by individuals as many people are put in similar situations. I think we can also draw on each other's experiences and expand upon the underlying true message of the experience and relate it back to ourselves. Knowing each other for decades is a feeling that rarely comes and it is difficult to explain how and why it happens.","I'd imagine someone would get angry with me because I was careless with the task given to me. This could be being late to an event, losing something important, forgetting where I kept something I always have, and so much more. I would feel really bad about the situation because I know this is something I need to work on but it's difficult for me to improve on this issue. I think I don't prioritize information correctly in my brain and go on autopilot after a certain amount of time, causing me to be careless and undisciplined.","I think I would have received an award for being the most organized and assisting a lot. I think I would've achieved this award through hard work in a specific organization through planning and assisting organizers with clean up and other mundane tasks. I would feel okay about receiving the award. It would feel get to get recognized but also a little unnecessary, like I don't really deserve to get the award."
48552,"This has to be some sort of external force, like God giving a sign and giving a farewell chance for your loved one. There has to be some sort of outside force that connects that, especially if you never have that dream before. There could be some sort of outside force that helps you feel their death in your sleep. It is a fairly common thing for mothers to have similar experiences I have heard. ","Honestly in today's world we probably would have followed each other on social media or had friends that would post pictures with them. I feel that this happens a lot, and then when you finally meet that person it feels like you have known them before. It is a weird situation because you never want to talk on things that they might have on social media, but you know that they did something or traveled somewhere. That would definitely be why we would share this weird feeling of knowing each other.  ",Someone would probably be angry at me for something small and trivial like getting cut off in the parking lot. If I stole their parking spot or accidentally cut them off they could be having a bad day and get angry at me. I am not a person that makes people get mad at me personally. But in some of these small trivial cases I may get angry back because I did not intend to make someone mad.,I probably would have received that award for leading some sort of project or fundraiser. I like to plan events and have a leadership position and help others get rewarded for their actions. I think that I would have probably downplayed the award and would not have enjoyed it as much in the moment. Mainly because I would have just seen it as the thing to do in terms of putting on that event for charity.
87790,"I think dreams are connected to how we feel, but also help us engage in the future of who we want to be. They are an outlet to solve our problems and offer us a hypothetical situation into how we could work through the difficult parts of our lives. If I had a dream that my far-away loved one unexpectedly visits me to impart life wisdom and say they love me, I believe it happens because as people depart in life, they send signs. I am a firm believer in signs through prayer, dreams, and physical objects. Even though I did not know about the death, there was a physical and spiritual connection that brought us together through love. ","There is an instinctive deja vu that I get with this person. Every time I see her, she reminds me of a certain memory. She keeps me thinking about my past, and surprises me by her perspective on how she thought she knew me before we met. I think this happened because we were meant to be together, or at least to have each other as acquaintances in life. Something, whether it was both of us being involved in similar situations in life or engaging in similar activities, brought us together to meet, and I believe that leaning into that feeling is the most important part of understanding my relationship with that person. ","They are angry with me because I forgot to do something. I missed a deadline, or I simply put something off that I should have finished earlier. The constant mistakes of forgetting to follow-up and update that person on my status led them to be angry with me. I feel disappointed in myself for not staying on top of things, and forgetting about doing a task that I should have finished earlier for this person. A person's connection and trust in someone else is based on reliability, and if I cannot possess that, then I am not completely fulfilled as a person. ","I received an award for using my passions to help others. The award was not an obligation, but simply part of my journey in discovering who I am. I was able to achieve this award by simply being myself and following my interests and engaging in new experiences that would broaden my horizons as an individual. I feel extremely honored to receive this award, and realize that this is a sign that I am on the right path in life. "
29440,I think this happens because you subconsciously know that something bad is going to happen.  I think our brains know that something unfortunate is going to happen before we are aware of it.  This would explain impending feelings of doom.  Our brain may be trying to prepare us for bad news. ,I think that this happened because we knew each other in our past lives.  I think that we must have crossed paths at some point in the past.  This would explain the instant connection and understanding of each other.  This has happened to me once or twice.,"Someone is angry with me for not spending enough time with them.  They got angry because I was unable to execute our plans because I was too stressed out and had too much homework.  I feel upset about this situation because I didn't cancel plans because I didn't want to see this person, I canceled plans because I didn't have the social battery to do them.  I often find myself too stressed to execute plans. ",I received the award for MVP on a sports team.  I achieved this award by working very hard toward my goals and by dedicating a lot of time to the sport.  I worked every single day in order to become to best.  I feel very honored and proud of myself for receiving this award. 
11158,"Honestly, I'm not sure how these things happen. I believe God definitely has something to do with it, but there is still so much mystery involved with situations like these. I believe instances like these are a way of God guiding us along our journey. It definitely isn't easy though.","I think meeting someone like that would come out of the blue...like meeting them at a coffee shop or something. It would probably catch me and the other person off guard, but as a pleasant surprise, not something neither of us didn't want. When strange but amazing encounters occur like this one, I think God has something to do with it. Meeting people that are so automatically related to us isn't random; I think God has a plan for each and every one of us.","If someone was angry with me, I think it would be due to a lack of intentionality or honesty. I've gone through a lot in my life, and sometimes I find it hard opening up myself to others. If I were in a situation where I didn't let a close friend or significant other know about my entire life history, the slipping of the truth wouldn't be the smoothest experience. Honestly, a situation like this kind of freaks me out.","I believe I received an award for being an outstanding peer, friend, and mentor. I honestly don't know, the thought of winning an award like that just came to mind. I hope I achieved it through genuinely being there for others and valuing those around me. It makes me feel good, but I definitely don't like the idea of sitting in my success."
53023,"I think that this happens because it is God's way of allowing them to say goodbye to me. It also is to give me some closure of knowing I got to ""see"" them one last time. I believe that there is life after death so this would be a way to get life wisdom from someone I care about until I am able to see them again. God sends us messages in mysterious ways sometimes, and in this case the message came through a dream. ","I think people have the feeling of knowing a stranger for a long time because they have gone through many of the same things in life. The things we go through shape our personality and the way we go about life. If you run into someone who has experienced many of the same obstacles and triumphs, then they may act, talk, or carry themselves in a similar way to you, thus creating this sense of connection. This mutual understanding of each other because of a shared past could lead to you feeling like you've known them for decades. ","Whenever I am stressed, I snap at people sometimes, so someone might be mad at me because I snapped at them. If they were pressuring me or asking too many questions about something I was already anxious about I would take out my anger on them. I feel guilty when this happens. I also feel like I need to work on that issue I have so that I don't hurt other people. ","I received an award for an academic accomplishment. It is for research that I have done in the field I am studying, psychology. I was able to achieve this award by committing myself to whatever research I was doing and making it a priority in my life. I feel very accomplished and proud of myself. I also feel like I proved to myself that I can do hard things in my life. "
81089,"I think that this would happen because of a higher-power being or spirit that is related to the afterlife. If this were to happen, I would be more convinced of a life beyond our own. I would know that I had a great connection with this loved one that they felt the need to visit before they died. I think that their spirit would know that they needed to give me and them some peace before they went to the afterlife.","Since this scenario is more realistic, I would think that this was just a coincidence. I would not be convinced that this person and I actually knew each other, maybe in another life. Instead, I would think that maybe we each knew another person with similar personalities that we associated as already knowing them. I think that this feeling would be totally unrelated to the afterlife or any spiritual connections.","I think that someone would be angry at me for not thinking hard enough about their feelings. I think that I would do something rash and not think it through enough, and another person would end up getting hurt. They may become angry at me for this reason, and this would cause me to feel very badly. I would want to fix the situation in any way that I could to try to make them and myself feel better. ","I think that I would receive an award for excellence in a certain class at school. I think that what would have brought me to achieve the award is through dedication to a class resulting in an overall good grade or some excellence on a project or assignment. I would feel proud to receive an award like this, and I would feel as though my work here has been appreciated. I think that any award I receive would have something to do with academics because that is generally where I excel the most. "
53480,I think that sometimes dreams are able to almost predict the future. In this dream it would be almost like them coming to say goodbye because they are not able to do it in person. I think that this would be saddening to actually happen but it would also feel very meaningful to know that they loved you and everything they said to you.,"I am not totally sure about this one. I don't necessarily fully believe or am convinced about reincarnation, but I am not fully against the idea either. So for this situation I would probably say that they were friends from the past and were reincarnated or that there are just certain personality traits which people just click with one another on and have a sense of warmth and familiarity with. ","I am probably angry with someone if they were doing a lot of small things which annoyed me and then it kept building up or if someone lied to me. This could have been a built up thing or more of someone was being hypocritical or lying to me which would make me mad. I would first just be very frustrated and not understanding why this happened. I would then, depending on the lie, want to confront them and ask them why they did what they did. ",If I were to just receive an award it would most likely be an academic award because I feel that those are the most awards I have received in the past. I was able to achieve this award by taking leadership skills and applying them to help with my classmates along with striving to be my best and put full effort into all of my work. I feel proud of myself for receiving this reward and I also feel good to see that my hard work paid off.
78649,It could be possible I had a strong intuitive sense about an event as drastic as someone who is close to me passing away. I am not sure what could be said about such an event other than it seems like there must be an energy that is bound to the two of us or the act of dying. It could also be a coincidence or a transcendental experience. I don't necessarily believe it's them communicating after death but maybe it's something like that paired with an intuitive feeling. ,"Similarities and a common background is the first thing that comes to mind. If I meet someone who is easy to talk to and feels like I've known them for decades, we probably have a lot in common in terms of past experiences. The type of people who have grown up in similar situations, went to the same schools, or played the same games feel more relatable and easier to talk with. I also think the person would need to be very open and kind for something like this to take place. 
","I feel if someone is angry with me it is because I forgot about them in some situation. Their anger could be attributed to making them feel I don't want to spend time with them or am unable to devote attention to them.A part of me feels challenges and misunderstood by their act of being angry. However, I also understand because I have felt a similar way where I feel forgotten or excluded and I would really feel more guilt than anything else.  ","I received the award for helping people in some way. I think it would be for an invention or idea that my business helps spread to people in need of it. I would be able to achieve the award with lots of help from inspiring people, my own determination, and lots of failures. I would feel excited about getting it, but I feel my excitement would depend on how important or significant the award is or how deserving I feel of the award. "
28435,"This happens probably because of some gut feeling that you have that they have parted. because of the distance, your subconscious automatically regrets not being able to speak to them for the last time, and it wants you to feel as though you did. especially with someone whom you truly love and would miss terribly, you would want to have a last conversation that would help you feel connected with them and have some wisdom that could later on connect you.","this is how I felt when I met my current boyfriend. I believe that this happens because you were destined to meet each other. your connection is so strong, and you have so much in common, that you believe that you guys have gone through all of your troubles together. or even so much so that your subconscious WANTS to believe that you have been through life together and that's why you're immediately so close.","in this hypothetical scenario, I would imagine that they are mad at me for messing up a job or a paper, or some sort of work. what led them to be angry with me is that I didn't do it properly, or I didn't do it the way they would have liked for me to do it. This makes me feel conflicted because I did what was bets with my abilities and possibly with the resources that i had. And I would be upset that they are angry at me in the first place instead of correcting me and trying to fix our problem.","i imagine that i just got some sort of award recognizing the good I have done in this world. I would like to believe that I received said award for ,my compassion, for my generosity, and for my selflessness, and that it is being appreciated in a way that can be materialized. this would make me very happy because I feel validated for what I have done, and I feel like I have lived my life in a way that is meaningful, and it assures me that I have in fact helped people."
58705,"I think I would have the dream because I felt something unconsciously wrong. I don't really have an explanation for why the two things would be correlated or how I could possibly know about their passing before the dream, but I think it would just be one of those things that just happen. There isn't a scientific explanation, just the bond between two people that can't be explained.","I think this happens because the person shares a very similar personality with me. I've experienced this feeling before and although we didn't agree on everything I felt a closeness almost instantly that I usually got after knowing someone for many years. Our personalities weren't the exact same, but we had similar interests and thought about things in a similar way. The main thing was there was just compatibility between us and that dynamic probably caused that feeling.","The person would probably be angry with me during an argument, in which I was being stubborn about something. They would have been angry because arguments like these normally have no right answer, its about what a specific person believes in. In this situation, I wouldn't necessarily get angry in response, but if their explanation makes no sense and they resort to just yelling over me to get their point across I would get angry.","I probably received the award for something I didn't know came with an award, and was just something that I was doing at the time. I would achieve this award by working towards a goal that I had and when I realized there was an award, I would add that into the plan. If received an award in this way, I would probably feel happy but not extremely happy because it isn't something that I had set out to do from the beginning. "
44821,"I would believe in some sort of other plan of existence. I would be exhilarated and devastated. It would feel good in the sense that I would have proof in life after death, at least in some way, and I could believe that there was something bigger than myself, but devastated at the loss.",I probably fall in love. I may feel guilty because I'm in a relationship. I feel exhilarated and sad and immediately miss them. I mull over whether or not to end things with my partner and if this new meeting is just a random coincidence. I don't end things with my partner unless these feelings persist for 6 months.,"they're angry with me because I said something blunt or an offhand statement. This hurt their feelings, or it was just embarrassing and uncalled for. I feel guilty and ruminate. I would apologize for any unnecessary harshness but I do not apologize for anything I think is merited.",I received an award for dedication to someone/something. I spent many hours investing in this person/thing. I went above and beyond in what I needed to do. I feel very proud of myself and very proud of my accomplishment.
46757,I believe that my loved one died and visited me in my dream. I believe that there is some kind of afterlife that allows this to happen.,I think this happens because some people share very similar interests and personality traits. They get along very well and its easy for them to have good conversations with each other. This makes it feel like they have known each other for years. It also may be that they have met someone similar to the person they feel like they have known for years.,They are angry with me because I don't spend enough time with them. I may have constantly blown them off or said I was too busy to hang out. I feel disappointed in myself. I would apologize and tell them that I will put in more effort to spend time with them.,I received the award for being the most productive. I was able to achieve this by staying focused on my academic and personal goals. I also gained motivation from those around me who pushed me to work hard. I feel happy about receiving this award because I feel that it was well-deserved.
82369,I think that this might have happened from some higher power/entity trying to give you one last good memory from your loved one. It could have also just been you thinking about this person so you had a dream about them. Seeing them in your dream could also just be a form of reminders for important life advice to follow. The advice coming in this form might be because you have been avoiding something important in your life.,"You might feel like you know them because you just connect with them very easily and it feels very natural to talk to them and be around them. It could also be from a past life experience where you knew them in a different life or universe. Additionally, this might happen because if they you believe in the concept of soulmates or twin flames where they are so similar to you that you guys are connected by some force in the universe.","They might be angry with me because of something that I did that bothered them with me knowing. It could also be from my opinions about certain topics that they may not agree on. I would not feel pleasant about the situation if someone was angry with me. I would try talk it out and with them to find a common ground, but I would not persist in finding a solution or apologizing if they continue to hold a grudge. ",I might have received an award for my academic performance. I was able to achieve this award because of my work ethic and strong desire for good grades. I would feel very happy about getting an academic award because I would feel like I am being recognized for my efforts. This award would motivate me to keep up what am doing. 
31926,"I have two different ways of answering this question. From a religious side, I would consider that a blessing from God, and feel very grateful for being allowed to see my loved one's spirit one last time. On the other hand, a more rational approach would suggest that you simply think about that person subconsciously from time to time, and a desire to see them again brought them into your dreams. ","I suspect that if such a sense were to develop between two people, it is a result of good chemistry. These two people posses personality traits and mannerisms that either are very similar or complement each other very well. Personally, I get that sort of sense when I share an ideal or value with someone, such as a desire to live off in the woods.  ","the last few times someone has been angry with me, I have let my competitive side get the better of me and made me unpleasant to be around. I tend to have a short fuse when offered criticism, and when playing a sport this can boil over quite quickly. I feel this is an area where I can improve personally, and I suspect improving my self esteem will help. ","I likely received the award for writing, as that is really the only place where I feel I could stand out above the crowd. I was able to achieve this through developing a creative mind and wide vocabulary as a child through voraciously reading. I feel validated through getting this award, and maybe I am capable of success after all. "
40309,"I think this happens because you have a connection to them and might be able to sense that something is wrong subconsciously. I also think it gives you closure in a way such that they are able to tell you what they need to before they pass. Even though you don't get a proper goodbye, in a way you are able to talk them. Regardless of it is in a dream, I think this happens so that you can know they love you and care for you. ","I think with some people you just click instantly. Even if you have only known them for a few days, you can get close so quickly that it feels as if you have known them for years. Another explanation could be that they remind you of someone you already know. Perhaps a friend from childhood or someone else in your life resembles this person you are meeting for the first time. ","Someone is angry with me because I was being extremely indecisive about an important issue. No matter how hard I tried to come to a decision, I could not determine which consequence I would rather deal with. They were soon becoming impatient with me as I was taking too long to decide. I feel sad and disappointed in myself because I never want to upset people (I am definitely a people pleaser) on account of my actions. ",I received the award for an accomplishment in my career. I was able to achieve this award through hard work and time spent researching a computational or mathematical issue. I feel proud of myself and it also serves as a reminder not to underestimate myself. I think sometimes you just need a reminder that you are capable of achieving big things and to push through tough times. 
84070,"I think the connection we have with people especially those who are close and share the same blood has an effect on people. I think humans can sense departure of this world or the other loves you so much they come to ""visit.""","I think this uncanny sense that we've know each other for decades may come from similarities. Some similarities may include fashion sense, trauma, and similar upbringing. Having shared experiences and bond two people together very fast.",Someone is angry at me for not planning well. Sometimes I like ti be spontaneous as it provides thrill in life but someone could have been caught up with those plans. I would definitely feel really bad and try to do anything to fix the situation as I am an over thinker.,I received an award for being empathetic. I achieved this since a lot of my friends have told me this and the stranger I just talked said as well. I feel good about receiving it since I try hard to listen and provide support to others.
61818,"I would interpret this as, first, the person loves me as much as I love her. Second, I think that is a sign of us caring about each other. The action of the unexpected visit and saying they love me might hint that we did not express our love to each other that much before. ","This may happen when during the conversation, I found we had a lot of similar experience. Another reason may be that we share some interests in common, like music or books. I think if our personalities are compatible, such sense will also appear. In general, it is most likely to happen when there is a large number of shared things.   ","They are angry with me because they are mad at something I did. However, it might not be that i actually did something wrong, it can be a miscommunication. If the person is someone I am close with, I will try to spend time figuring out why they are mad at me, but if the person is not close, I will just let it go with out worrying to much about it. ","I received the award for engaging everyone in the community. I achieved that because I enjoy talking to people and consider their feelings. I feel very proud and happy at the moment. After a few hours, I won't feel as excited when I look at the award. "
