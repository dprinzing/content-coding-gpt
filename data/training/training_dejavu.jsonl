{"prompt":"I think I might feel a sense of uncanny familiarity when meeting a person because they remind me of someone I already know. They might be a combination of looking like someone I know, sounding like them, behaving like them, or even just some subconscious similarity.

{"prompt":"I think this happens when you meet someone with similar disposition and emotions as you. It can seem like you've known them for some time since they are portraying similar traits to you.

{"prompt":"Sometimes the situation reminds you of someone you went through something similar with. Other times the situation reminds you of something else you went through with someone else through. I think it happens because people try to have things makes sense in their worlds. Relating things to something similar or familiar makes things more relatable and understandable for most people. I feel sometimes people do have instant bonding like that, a feeling of home residing in someone else of a an experience they have had before.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 5 4 5\n"}

{"prompt":"Some people are attune to each other, either because of similar interests, personalities, or way in which they carry themselves.

{"prompt":"This could happen because they take on traits of others that have been in our life. We can be associating their mannerisms with people we have known for a long time.

{"prompt":"My first inclination was to think that perhaps we are long-lost siblings, separated at birth. This was probably my first thought because I recently listened to a podcast about twins who were separated in infancy and then reunited later in adulthood.

{"prompt":"I think this feeling would likely be because we shared similar life experiences that make it easy for us to relate to one another. Sometimes I bond quickly with people that seem to be on the same \"wavelength.\" I usually think this is because we have many of the same characteristics more than any kind of divine intervention.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 5 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"There's the possibility that we are just innately similar people with similar life experiences, interests, and motivations. I feel like this often happens during intense or transformative points in life(ie. when you finally meet someone you hit it off with after being in a new city where you don't know anyone who really 'gets' you yet.

Part of me is also interested in thinking about fate, destiny, and the metaphysical when it comes to these things.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 6 6 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I've actually had that experience recently. It happened with someone I had just met but we had gone to the same school.

{"prompt":"I think that the other person has similar interests and hobbies that would make me want to get to know the person more.

The more similarities one has, the more I would be comfortable opening up.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think some personalities just really go well together and people bond instantly when they make that kind of connection. In my opinion, it's really rare to find this sort of strong connection with another person, which is why it can feel uncanny or spooky.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Well, for one thing we know that everyone is connected to one another by up to 6 individuals. Similarly, when we share an uncanny sense that we've known someone for decades it often is due to something we feel in common or in connection with that individual. In particular this may occur or would make sense if something was physically similar to another person I've known for a long time or an interest or mannerism reminds me of a close relation (Friend/family). It's possible there could be something about the other individual that reminds me of someone I knew or witnessed as the person I identified with in the moment may act, speak, or behave in a more pronounced manner than the individual they remind me of.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 7 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I am a very friendly person and often seek out topics that i have in common with others to initiate a conversation. If I experience the situation above, it's because i discovered something that we mutually have in common and share a similar sense of appreciation for.

{"prompt":"I imagine this would be because of characteristics that the person has that they share with a person/people I have known for decades. I don't believe in the idea of knowing someone from a last life or anything along those lines. I think it would be more likely that the way they speak, act, mannerisms they use, how they look, etc. are familiar which would give the sense of knowing the person for decades.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 4 2 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I think this happens when you get a good feeling from someone and they remind you of someone who is or was very close to you for a long time. As much as people are different, they are very similar too, so running across someone who feels super familiar can be rare but not all that rare.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 5 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I think that characteristics of people's personality can be remembered in our minds for a long time; especially if they are uncanny from the usual. So, if later in life we meet someone else with the same uncanny characteristic, we tend to think of the original person who had that same characteristic.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This seems very unlikely and hard to believe because I have never felt like this before or heard any friends/family talk about such an experience. If this were to actually occur, I guess I would think it would be something like reincarnation. I am not particularly spiritual or religious, but if were to experience this, I would like for an explanation and believe my own feelings (assuming I actually felt them and someone was not trying to convince me I feel this way)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 6 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I think this happened because we were intended to share encouragement with one another about a situation (e.g., past hurt, recent loss, upcoming positive or negative changes).

Just that we meet people everyday, some who we randomly become close with instantly, and some who may never have an impact on our life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 4 2 3 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I think some people click right away, maybe it's their aura or maybe it's simply the way they carry themselves.

{"prompt":"I have sometimes met people who I felt extremely close to and comfortable around, very quickly. I always attribute this to someone's \"energy\", and whether or not that energy is compatible with my own. Instances where I immediately feel like I've known someone for a long time are generally coupled with a sense that this person's behaviors are likely predictable. This is probably because their story, or mannerisms, remind me of someone else in my life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 6 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"For the same reason, the universe works in ways that we are not completely able to grasp. And I accept not knowing all the why's.

When that happens, I feel in alignment and blessed to be guided.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 7 7 7 5 6\n"}

{"prompt":"I think this happened because they have a combination of personality traits that really click with me. They might have a bit of personality from many people I know and of have known and who I enjoyed being around, so their personality reminds me of many of them combined.

{"prompt":"Growing up, my favorite books were the \"Anne of Green Gable\" series by Lucy Maud Montgomery. In the book, Anne's closest friends are what she calls \"kindred spirits.\" When I meet people that I felt I've known for decades, I like to think that we're kindred spirits and share many similarities, have a similar personality, and have similar dreams and aspirations in life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 4 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I do not know if I believe in reincarnation or past lives, but I definitely think it is a possibility. Even though people talk about the human soul a lot, we do not know if each soul is only occupied by one body. On a more practical level, the person and I could have similar identities and experiences that make us feel more connected. We could have this sense that we've know each other for decades because we are meant to be in each other's lives for some reason. Getting to know each other isn't the main reason for our interaction, but we may have needed to meet for a purpose we do not yet understand.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 6 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I would think in this case that perhaps we grew up in similar ways. That could mean the same location, type of household, etc. I think we would probably share deep interests in the same things so we would be able to talk on a deeper level about topics we both mutually knew well and had interest in.

{"prompt":"I would first try to see if there is any way that we might have mutual friends or met in the past before. If that was not true then I would think that we have a lot in common and we should be friends.

It was probably just entropy that helped us to meet each other.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 2 3 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I think that maybe our personalities just match very well. Perhaps our previous lives we knew each other. I am also not sure if I believe in previous lives but I have heard that there are theories that our souls live many lives and it could be that we knew each other very well in our past lives. It is also just possible that it is a coincidence and we just both feel that way because they remind us of someone that we know in our current life or have traits that are familiar to us.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 5 7 5 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think people are somewhat more generic than we like to think. I think also that we tend to focus on the familiar and the likable parts of others, so that can give us a skewed sense of connection.

{"prompt":"From the outset, I would attempt to approach this from a more logical point of view. Rather than outright denying or accepting their sensation, I would simply ask some leading questions to see if we had ever crossed paths (e.g. where are you from, where did you go to school or college, etc.) If there were no connections, I would imagine this sensation was created out of a link between someone they may already know or simply a coincidence. I would go through this process because I'm interested in what they have to say and why, even if it seems unnecessary or fruitless.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I believe that we lived in the spirit world before we came to earth, so it very well could be that I knew that person before.

{"prompt":"I think there are some people that you just click with which makes conversation and hanging out easy. This gives the sense that you have known each other for decades with how easy conversation flows.

I haven't had these experiences all too often, but I have had a few rare instances where I meet someone, perhaps we share an experience (i.e. a strange event or memorable moment), and the situation lends itself to learning more about that person's background and connecting on a deeper level. This combination leads to an immediate personal connection and shared experience that can go deeper than some shallower friendships over a long period.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Well, that is a totally unrealistic scenario. However, in the past several years I started noticing that my memory is no longer sharp enough, so I may forget people or names.

{"prompt":"There are some people that are very similar in personality and life experiences that make it easy for you to connect with. It wouldn't necessarily mean much beyond that, but it is great to meet someone like that. It may also make you think that maybe people get a second chance to come back to earth after death??? In a way, it gives you a chance to explore your religious identity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 4 5 6 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't know that I believe in past lives, but I do believe in kindred spirits. I think these kinds of feelings have to do with people connecting on a deep level.

{"prompt":"That would be a cool experience. It might be because we remind each other of someone else in our lives, or it might just be one of those unexplainable things.

I don't know if I believe that there is a such thing as past lives or if there is some essential \"us\"ness that continues across lives that might make me feel connected to someone I had never met, but I like thinking about it that way because that would be neat.

{"prompt":"I think that there are people and personalities that instantly click. If you mesh very well with a person, it can feel as if you've known them your whole life.

It is an interesting feeling to think about.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"This likely happened because people want to be close to others, so when we meet new people, we look for things that we have in common. Then, once we find that we have a specific thing in common with our new friend (e.g., we both like a certain song, or we both share an opinion about something), we work to build on that commonality. In short, we crave relationships and closeness, so we work to build relationships and closeness.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I also think we assign meaning to things that happen to us.

{"prompt":"I mostly think this happens because 2 people have very complementary personalities. I have personally not experienced this that many times in my life. Sometimes I wonder if there is a higher level of consciousness or existence upon which people can interact. When a scenario like this happens, I wonder if we have connected on some higher level, or maybe we were close friends in a past life.

{"prompt":"I think this happens when someone has lived a very parallel life to yours and it can feel like you know the other person even if you haven't meet them before.

{"prompt":"I believe this happens because our mind remembers good (or bad) parts about things in life and correlates them with prior experiences. I believe this can happen with a physical or a personality trait of the person, which would remind us of a friend or family member.

{"prompt":"I believe that people are inherently similar and that there is something tying each of us together.

{"prompt":"This has happened to me a couple of times - people who I instantly bond with, click with, and where we both act like we've known each other for years.

{"prompt":"Sometimes people just connect. I've had that experience once or twice and in my experience it comes from being raised in similar environments or having similar life experiences.

{"prompt":"It is most likely because they are not shy. Most of the time we connect with others when they have their guard down and are open with us, this allows us to connect over shared experiences which leads to the feeling of \"knowing eachother\" when in actuality you just see yourself in them.

{"prompt":"Most of me would think this was due to just the sometimes-fortunate randomness of the universe. I'd attribute it partly to luck and partly to the fact that feeling like you've known someone for decades is often because your perspectives and values are aligned, and that alignment can lead people to know the same group of people or be involved in the same activities.

{"prompt":"I just think they have a lot in common, and their personalities get along pretty well\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think it would occur because we recognized something familiar in each other. Either we reminded each other of ourselves, or someone we were close to.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I believe I would have had this feeling because the person I had just met strongly reminded me of someone I had known or encountered in the past. I don't believe I would feel that anything more was happening in this situation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 3 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I have had situations like this happen before, sort of like deja vu. I typically attribute it to I have met or seen someone that resembles them before either in-person or maybe on a TV show. Both physical attributes and personality mannerisms can cause this feeling. I don't exactly know the psychology behind it, but I think it has to do with old memories that resemble the person being brought back to the surface.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think some people are just naturally more compatible with and drawn to each other. That kind of enhanced compatibility could make me feel as though I've known them for longer than I have. However, part of me would also feel as though us meeting was somehow destined, and maybe that's why we feel so familiar to each other.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Some people have personality traits or other characteristics that remind you of someone you know or previously knew. It may be subtle enough that you cannot identify how you recognize those characteristics and so you attribute the sense of familiarity to something unrelated. It's also possible that this person shares very similar characteristics and interests to yourself, which could make you feel more close more quickly. Some people are simply more compatible with one another, and that compatibility may manifest as feelings of familiarity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe you met before a long time ago and their face looks really familiar. Or maybe some people just have really similar personalities that it feels like you know them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"We probably crossed paths or briefly met a long time ago but can't place where/when it was. Our brains mistook this previous meeting to mean that we have known each other for a long time, when really we just encountered each other once.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think this happens due to sharing similarities with another person, and to a sense of chemistry between people. Some people have similar personality traits or even life experiences, and can easily relate to each other in a way that almost feels like they've known each other for a long time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This scenario suggests that we are just super compatible with one another. Generally it means we share the same interests and can talk with each other to a great extent. The feeling seems as if we've known each other for so long because it is so rare to be around someone so compatible.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"It is possible that I may have seen this person in my dreams and therefore are very familiar with them despite having never met them. Or possibly they remind me of a good friend or family member who I am very close with.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 5\n"}
{"prompt":"I think sometimes we meet people that are good matches off the bat and this makes us belive that they may be a good firend or we have known them for a long time. I however think this is more just coincidence and not a alignemnt of the starts or outside event.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 3 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think this interaction was predestined by God and our similarities result from similar upbringings, worldviews, personalities, and interests. You haven't actually known each other for decades, but because that person is a lot like you, they remind you of yourself. Furthermore, since you have been \"yourself\" for a long time, the interaction stimulates the thought that you have known each other for decades.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 6 6 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"That can happen if a person looks very familiar to me and share some similar thoughts. I can also feel the same way if I think that we have a lot in common and realize this in a relatively short period of time, during a lunch for example.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I probably have met that person before, but I just don't remember it. It's likely that I knew them from my childhood or maybe met them once during college, but didn't get to know them very well. If given a little amount of time to talk to them about their background, I could probably figure out where I knew that person from.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I would think that I know this person for a few reasons, first they could resemble someone I have known in my past either the way they look or the way they carry their selves and because of the emotional connection I had with the person in the past it triggers that feeling with the new person. It could also be because I actually do know that person, I have moved around a lot so I have met many people and I could potentially run into them again. Lastly I could have that sense because I either see the same qualities in them that I see in most people because I have a set of qualities I look for in people.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe they have a similar sense of humor to me, or share a lot of personal details about themselves that makes me feel like we know eachother well enough. also that would make me feel like they are similar to me bc i tend to share a lot of personal details.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think that this likely happened because they remind of someone that I do actually know and feel fondly about. Alternatively I could have a spiritual connection to the person that I just met that especially resonates. I do not believe you need to know someone for a specified amount of time to feel a deep connection with them and often times we make snap judgments about whether we connect with someone or not. I think things like this happen because everything happens for a reason, and there is always an underlying reason why and how someone enters your life at a given time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 6 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This would probably happen if they look familiar potentially, like an old friend, maybe subconsciously. I also know that peoples smells can make them seem familiar if it's nostalgic for you.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think there are people we relate to and get a sense that we have 'known them forever' even though we have just met. I think that this happens because our values and spirits align, and the universe is telling us that we are meant to be connected with this individual. I also think this does not happen frequently, and when it does it makes us more aware.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 7 6 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"We likely have quite a bit in common (e.g. have some connections, know similar people, have shared similar experiences, have similar interests/hobbies/aspirations). I think this could have happened because we also have similar personalities and were able to comfortably engage in meaningful conversation, rather than merely a surface level interaction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"The connection or vibe shared with this person would make me feel like I've known them or they could remind me of someone I know.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Lots of people share similar facial features and idiosyncrasies. Or maybe it was just a really good personality connection/match.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I have no idea! I would think I maybe knew them in grade school or something and just forgot. I'm really not sure how to answer this.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I tend to look for similarities when I meet people for the first place. I have spent time in different places and have interests in a variety of things, so having similar backgrounds, interests, and personalities would certainly make me feel more connected than not.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"If we shared an uncanny sense that we've known each other for decades, I imagine that we have lots of similar characteristics and experiences.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I would be trying very hard to pinpoint why I had this feeling by trying to compare that person to other people in my life to see if it was a certain physical feature or characteristic reminding me of someone I knew. I would also be trying to find possible overlaps in our pasts in which we might have met. Otherwise, I would likely just take it as a sign of compatibility.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I've never had this happen so it's hard to contextualize for me. I would expect that as you speak with the other person and they share very similar life experiences as you or that they are very similar to someone you know, that this feeling might arise. I've had feelings of deja vu before, but always in the context of experiences; never people. I've usually chalked it up to dreams.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"If you connect on a certain level you can feel like you have known them\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Sometimes I feel that there are individuals who come into your life that you instantly connect with because of that feeling of having know each other for decades. I couldn't hazard a guess for why this occurs, but perhaps it is just your mind letting you know that this person is indeed a friend who you can trust and count on no matter what. I think meeting someone who you feel you have know for decades would happen more to individuals in their later twenties and later, and perhaps this feeling is because that person reminds you of someone else you already know.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Likely, it would happen from shared interests, but it could also be that they sound or look like someone you already know, so you associate them with someone else (even if you can't place them exactly).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I actually have this experience quite often. I believe that there are lots of similarities in the people we navigate toward. So, it quite often feels like we knew that person, but we actually knew similar traitis and mannerisms in another person at some point in our lives. Again, part of me wants to believe that there is a spiritual connection of some sort, but I'm not sure I believe that.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"We have a lot in common or they remind me of someone I already know and am close to.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 5\n"}

{"prompt":"I think that it's probably just a situation where there is something about their mannerisms or appearance that reminds you of something or someone in your past in a positive way. Subconsciously there's something about them that you like because of it and it makes you feel comfortable around them and like you know them.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This is fate and that I was meant to be introduced to this person or get to know this person. We have the same kindred spirit.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 6 6 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think this happens because when you have so much in common with someone and you have such a great connection and both have a warm feeling around each other.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 6 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I believe that people can give off vibes or create the feeling of familiarity. So I would just take it as something about me reminds them of a similar feeling that they have had before with someone they are familiar with. Nothing too surprising there. I think it is totally normally.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Some people just have an instant connection and you can feel a closeness; maybe it's because of common life experiences.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 5\n"}
{"prompt":"I would understand this feeling if we had so much in common or if they reminded me in someone that I have known for a long time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This feeling would stick with me for a long time, and I would wonder a lot about why it happened. I might consider that the universe had a reason for us to meet - I guess that would be called fate. But sometimes you have chemistry with a person for no identifiable reason.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 7 6 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"We've probably had very similar experiences and/or have similar or well fitting personalities so the bond between us has been established very quickly.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I suspect it's because the person is someone from my childhood who I didn't remember, or if it is truly the first time we've ever met, that it is someone who shares many personality traits of a childhood friend. It is likely that the other person may have had a friend that shares my personality traits because those traits would \"click\".\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I often think of those as \"I found my tribe\" moments. That there is some shared experience or world view that connects us to each other. I feel like they understand me and I understand where they are coming from.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 5\n"}
{"prompt":"I have heard people experience this with people who they are now very close friends with. I like to think that we all do meet people with whom we just click right away, giving us that sense that we have known them for decades. Feel like we are all searching perhaps for connection all the time and this allows us to open up to some more than others.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"In this case, I may have reminded this person of someone that they have known for a longer period of time. We may have personalities, personal preferences, beliefs, and/or experiences that are very similar. I believe this can make two people feel like they have known each other for a longer period of time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 3 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe because they resemble someone you know or something they say brings to mind a memory that happened in the past.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This is a possibility because this might be someone that reminds me of a person in my past or they remind me of something that makes me feel nostalgic. I'd probably say that this person was meant to be in my life because that feeling is very special and important.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 7 6 4 5\n"}
{"prompt":"I would assume that if we haven't actually known each other in the past that it's simply a great example of coincidence. Sooner or later weird things just happen to people.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 2 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This has happened to me, in a way. Sometimes I think it's because we have a lot in common -- where we grew up, went to school, beliefs we share. I've also read that this is a way your brain makes you feel more at ease with someone or a situation, by making it seem familiar.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 2 3 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Some people just click more than others, usually through a similar life trajectory or history. That means even if I don't know them well, I feel like I do because we're on the same wavelength or approach things similarly and so can jump to a deeper level of friendship or understanding that feels like it's based on years of previous knowledge.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 5 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think this could happen if you have matching or corresponding personalities that mesh well with each other. I don't necessarily believe that this would be due to knowing each other from a previous life.

{"prompt":"I believe this may have happened because you may share a lot of similarities with this person and it may just feel like there is an instant connection with the person. This may have happened because there are people with whom you may just automatically connect with and be meant to be friends with. I think this may have happened because there are people who you just can automatically become friends with and perhaps you just feel that instant connection the moment you meet.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This is not entirely impossible for me to imagine. When I first met the man I married, we only knew one another from letters and a few phone calls over a period of almost six months. When I first saw him in person I felt that I knew him deeply and I knew he would be my husband one day. I feel that all things are connected in the universe and we are just along for the ride so we might as well enjoy it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 7 6 5 4\n"}

{"prompt":"Similar to the above explanation, while it might surprise me initially to have this encounter with someone I've just met, I would feel that there is a bigger and stronger power out there that has brought us to meet one another.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 7 6 6 4\n"}
{"prompt":"It probably happened because of a past relationship with someone that shares the same characteristics as the new person.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This could happen if we had a lot in common, such as where we're from or what we like to do.

I think that this ease in connection can feel like something spiritual, and it is, although maybe not supernatural or based on past lives.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 6 6 4 5\n"}
{"prompt":"I believe that this might happen, because the individual could have characteristics and manners that resembled someone else you may know.

{"prompt":"I do believe that this happens because people are for the most part, very similar. Everyone goes through different things/issues in their lives, but we are all very much the same.

{"prompt":"I would wonder if we had really met before -- I moved a lot as a child, so maybe they were someone I knew and forgot in one of those places.
