They probably had a rough day (or week, or month, or year!) and after holding it in all day I did something minor that they didn't like and it was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. I'm upset that they chose to hold in their anger and let it grow over time rather than dealing with each person or situation as it occurs.

They are then angry because I haven't truly spoken up about my feelings and I am not truly addressing the situation. My refusal to address the situation has just made things worse.

I don't like disappointing people either or being disappointed so I know where they may be coming from. I don't feel it's right to project onto other people, so I try not to and rather ask people what they are thinking or feeling instead of expecting something of them that they might not be promising me. I don't like people angry with me, but it happens.

I'd attempt to reschedule, but they were probably frustrated since I've likely done that before to them. Their friendship matters to me, so I would feel terrible about upsetting them.

I am often really busy due to my work responsibilities, and my work can be emotionally and energetically demanding, so when I have free time I want to use it to decompress and take my mind off things. If I'm reaching out to a friend/family/other loved one, then I always have the impulse to share what's stressing me out, which tends to be more taxing to me than being a source of relief. So if someones is angry at me for it, then I'd totally understand where they're anger is coming from but I'd also feel at least somewhat justified in attending to my own mental health. And then another part of me knows that I'd probably feel better after reaching out to that person simply due to the humor and connection I'd experience--but my conversations with loved ones also involved talking about serious or intense topics, which can be exhausting but are also necessary for my sense of being a thoughtful, socially critical person.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 5 3 5 5 3\n"}

I try to not make anyone purposefully angry, so if I do encounter that, I usually attribute it either to some kind of mistake I made or a misunderstanding, or to them dealing with something else that's causing them distress. There have been times when I realized that I said or did something unintentionally offensive after that fact, so of course that could be the reason.

I feel awful about having made a mistake but remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and what is more important is patterns of behavior. I would want to find a way to remedy the relationship (owning up to the mistake, setting plan for future actions) even if the mistake itself was something that couldn't be fixed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 7 6 6 1 2 1\n"}
{"prompt":"My boss is angry with me because I did not respond to her text. I had texted to say that I was planning to work from home today because I didn't have any meetings. She texted back to say that she needed me to come into the office. But I didn't receive her text, so I assumed that it was OK for me to work from home. The next day, she acted very strangely toward me until finally at the end of the day she asked why I didn't come in like she asked. I said I didn't get her text and showed her my phone to prove it. Then she understood, but still thought I should have followed up to make sure staying home was ok.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 5 3 3 3\n"}
{"prompt":"Usually it is one of my kids that is angry with me and almost always about having screen time taken away (or not earning enough screen time). She is also really angry with me because I'm probably on my phone (not necessarily doing work) while not letting her use hers. So I'm unfair and not applying the same standards - which means she's made at me for reasons that I stand behind and can't get her to understand. Which means we're actually both going to be mad at each other. And how did we get into this situation - probably something silly that could have been avoided (like she tried to watch tv before homework was done or didn't do a chore).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 7 5 2 3 3\n"}
{"prompt":"Someone (family member - husband or children) is angry with me for not spending enough quality time with them. They became angry because I was either working or doing tasks around the house instead of spending quality time with them. I feel sad and helpless about the situation because I want to spend quality time too and feel guilty when I do not, but I also want and need to get tasks accomplished around the house for my own sanity.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 4 3 4 3\n"}
{"prompt":"Someone is angry with me because I don't have the same opinion about something as them. They became angry with me because I wouldn't change my mind and \"side with them.\" I'm upset about the situation because I don't like when people are angry and I don't know how to fix it because I won't change my mind so we have to agree to disagree and move on.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 2 5 6 5\n"}
{"prompt":"They are angry with me because I spoke impulsively and didn't consider how they would feel. I pride myself with being transparent, and sometimes this is perceived as being bossy or overbearing. My intentions are almost always good, but again, sometimes I speak without fully trying to understand the impact that my words may have on others. I do not feel good about this situation because I usually try to go out of my way to keep the peace.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 6 5 5 3 3\n"}
{"prompt":"Someone is mad at me because I chose to complete a task completely opposite to the way they wanted it done. She feels that her way is the only way to do the task and do it correctly. She is upset that I was able to do the task and get the same or better results doing it my way and not hers and in less time. She doesn't want to discuss the results and how I got them and makes further discussions difficult. I think she is off base and that she isn't going to include me in on tasks again since I didn't do it her way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 2 1 6 6 7\n"}
{"prompt":"This person may be angry at me because I did not tell them that the things they were doing was frustrating towards me and that I eventually got too upset and did not approach my frustration at the best time or in the right way. They are probably angry because I handled a situation poorly and it made them uncomfortable. I feel upset and embarrassed and wish I could go back in time to change the situation and have said something sooner and in a different time to make the angry situation not a reality. I do not like when anyone is angry with me and want to try to make this person happy with me again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 5 6 2 2 2\n"}
{"prompt":"I am sad and frustrated that he is angry with me. I think it was just a misunderstanding. I cannot help that I feel a certain way about a particular situation. He is entitled to his opinion and feelings. WHY am I not entitled to my own just because they are different from his? I do not understand why he is so angry about what I said. I was trying to be supportive and he took it the wrong way and feels that I have attacked his character.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 4 6 3 2 4\n"}

{"prompt":"My friend is angry with me because I failed to reconnect with them on two to three visits back to my hometown ever since I left that town and moved South about 20 years prior. I feel a sense of guilt and selfishness because no matter where my life has led me and how many new responsibilities I may have as a father and husband, I feel as if I still should be able to make time for this old friend. However, I also feel that I should not beat myself up over it entirely because many of my old friends stay connected through social media and I have chosen not to make that a part of my life. Some of my friends have noted that I don't get to see what the old gang is up to since I'm not following or friending them. When I hear that, I mostly smile to myself as that is not something I want injected into my daily life and it brings me comfort over feeling guilty on the whole.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 5 6 2 3 2\n"}
{"prompt":"I said something they did not like at the time. They were tired and had a migraine. It really bothers me that they took their \"Not feeling well\" out on me.

{"prompt":"My spouse is angry with me because I didn't pay the phone bill on time and they're tired of checking on me to make sure I'm doing this. They think it can mess up our credit by paying bills late and they are already stressed enough as it is without having to follow up on household tasks that I'm in charge of.

{"prompt":"someone is angry with me for being too pragmatic and not being more sensitive to their needs or situation. i saw that their actions were not appropriate, and instead o asking them what was going on that caused them to do that, i made a judgement. I gave them the report early, they didnt review it until the night before it was due, and then made me fix it late that night. I was angry i had to stay up to fix it, and that the other person took so long to review it, without considering that maybe they were sick, or had a family emergency.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 3 2 3\n"}

{"prompt":"They are angry with me because I am hovering and being overly concerned and worried. They feel I worry to much about everything in general and it is irritating.

{"prompt":"Someone could be angry with me because I tend not to sugar-coat things. When someone comes to me asking for help or advice, I listen to them and tend to give them straight answers or ask them questions to make them think more or to see things differently and sometimes people do not like that. Some people just want a response of, I'm in your corner and \"you are right and you are accurate in feeling the way you're feeling\" answer, but I don't always give them that. I do not like when people are angry with me, but I understand that I'm not someone that everyone can love/like.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 5 3 6 5 3\n"}

{"prompt":"She is probably angry with me for saying something that was perceived to be unkind but was not meant that way. Often things said can be misinterpreted, especially something over a text or email message. I always feel badly when I suspect that I've made someone else feel bad, and I will always want to do what I can to remedy that.

I feel sad that they are angry, and I want to explain my side of the story, but it's hard for me to communicate my thoughts and feelings.

{"prompt":"People are angry at me a lot because of the nature of my job. I have to constantly tell people what they can or can not do because of a law, policy or process at work. I usually sympathize with those who might be upset and try to see if there is anything that I can do that would be a compromise. Sometimes that doesn't work because people want what they want.
