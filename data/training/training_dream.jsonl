{"prompt":"I would assume that dreams about loved ones visiting are fairly common and that this kind of dream is rather similar to other dreams I've had when nobody ended up dying. Also, if someone died in a relatively expected way (sickness, elderly, etc.) I would assume they were more on my mind recently than if they had died suddenly (car crash, shooting, etc.). I think dreams have a lot of meaning because they reflect your thoughts from the last day(s).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 4 3 3 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think that some part of the universe is trying to tell you that something is going to happen to that person.

{"prompt":"Dreams of loved ones occur all the time; we take special notice when something tragic happens in close proximity, like a death.

{"prompt":"I would not know how to explain this happening. I am religious and believe in God, but I'm not entirely sure I believe in spirituality in that sense that a loved one will visit us after death, as this is implying. I think that we think about those we love and there are weird coincidences all the time. We often dream about things we are emotionally connected to, and then after waking up do not remember or do not assign meaning to it until we decide it has meaning. In this case, the dream may have had an individual in it imparting wisdom, but it was not until after learning the loved one has passed that you make the assumption the one in the dream was the loved one who has passed in an effort to feel close to the deceased individual again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 5 5 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Unless their death was sudden, I've likely had this loved one on my mind a lot recently. As such, it is not strange that I would dream of them most nights as they go through this ordeal.

{"prompt":"I think that this was their way of telling me what they needed to, before they left the earth. Our subconscious could also be telling us, in dream form, that something is wrong before it happens.

It could be our own minds way of coping with the death, to protect us.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 6 7 7 5\n"}

{"prompt":"I would think the most likely explanation for this is because I knew that person was probably near to death anyway, and the dream was my subconscious' way of reflecting the guilt I have about not having made the best use of our time together while my loved-one was still alive.

{"prompt":"I believe this is possible, but more likely a result of an emotional or chemical response to an unknown change/sense of the loss and therefore a compensation with what I believe they may say to me if I had physically been there. It may be possible that this could occur as their spirit leaves this world, but I'm not sure. Regardless, the matter of how this happened is not overly important. Rather it would be the comfort of their last words and love and the effect this wisdom has on my memory of them and how I continue their legacy. If this provides someone comfort during a time of mourning and adjustment, why does the 'how' really matter? Our brains adapt in amazing ways and if this dream provides me with comfort and the means to continue or begin a strong legacy - what does it matter. I believe in the Old Testament stories about God using dreams to send individuals messages or insight. The presence of this today is debatable. But again, one must ask, does the how really matter? The wisdom, presuming it is wisdom, is gleaned and beneficial to the recipients life.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 4 5 6 6\n"}

{"prompt":"Honestly, I don't know why something like this would happen. I suppose maybe something in my subconscious knew that something was going on--maybe the loved one had been sick or was generally nearing the end of their life--so my brain presented my underlying thoughts through dreams.

Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, your mind may have reverse engineered the dream when you woke up to fit the information that you just gained. You may have had a dream where you were rehashing some experiences and working out the best course of action and then you put your loved-one's image in there after the fact as you wanted there to be some final connection with them.

{"prompt":"I think this dream would have happened possibly because after my loved one passed away they visited me in my dreams in death.

{"prompt":"If I were still as religious as I used to be, I would say that this is due to the soul leaving the body of the said loved one.

{"prompt":"This phenomenon is hard to explain. I don't believe in ghosts or spirits, but in some ways, this situation sounds like a spirit -- or maybe God -- would have visited me in the dream. More likely, I believe this is an example of selective hindsight; when I found out that the person died, I remembered that I had a dream about them. This dream would not have seemed significant if the loved one had not died.

{"prompt":"I think their spirit was communicating with me, definitely!

{"prompt":"If the person was previously sick, I would think that I'd recognize that my subconscious was already thinking about them and that's why they showed up in my dream.

{"prompt":"I am not religious but I am somewhat spiritual and I believe that there is a higher order that we are not aware of. I'm not sure if I believe in the afterlife or ghosts, but I think it could be possible that there may be a way to communicate with each other telepathically (even if that sounds silly).

{"prompt":"There is a belief that there is only so much energy in the universe and it just constantly renews. So that energy would eventually find its way back to you in the form of a loved one.

{"prompt":"I think it may have happened because they were already in my thoughts or I may have seen them the day before. Dreams are nothing more than your brain consolidating the past days events.

It's possible that one memory sticks out once I learned that my loved one died (and maybe I would not have recalled that dream if they had not).

If the death was the result of declining health and I was aware of my loved one's illness, it could have been coincidental that the death occurred the night before the dream, and the dream was the product of my anxiety about them.

{"prompt":"I believe this can happen when someone's soul leaves their body. Souls can visit anyone at any time.

{"prompt":"I do believe that sometimes you can sense when things are going to happen, like being contacted by people you know. The loved one might have had unfinished business to share with the intended and could not pass away without that person hearing/feeling what they had to say.

{"prompt":"This happened because there are certain connections in life that you cannot explain easily. It may not scientifically make sense, but in a way, that loved one was telling you goodbye. I firmly believe in the power of dreams and that some people do dream events that are yet to pass. In thinking of why it happened, I believe love connects people in a way that allows you to feel them and their feelings even when you are not physically next to each other. In a way your souls are connected and your loved one needed to tell you goodbye.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 7 6 6 6\n"}

{"prompt":"I think some people claim to have a higher level connection with loved-ones, and can sense when something bad has happened.

{"prompt":"I had an experience very similar to this when I was a teenager and my grandfather passed away. In retrospect, my grandfather had been very sick and I think the dream was a way of coming to terms with his decline in health at a fairly young age.

{"prompt":"I think that this would be particularly meaningful of an experience. I think that this may be coincidental, however. I think that you may experience thoughts like these if the person is particularly ill or if you are worried about losing that person in your life for whatever reason.

{"prompt":"psychic ability. i have a sense of these things often and I feel confident therefore that it is not coincidental. Also I feel that they have few ways of connecting with people still living (supposedly most adults, unlike very young children, or animals) and so it comes across that way. if they could do it by appearing to a person in a waking state I suppose they would do that.

It feels like they were really there and it was them. I think in the above case I would see it as your relative visiting you to say goodbye before leaving forever.

It could be that you already expected the person to pass away due to illness and it was your mind's way of playing through what was going on in the situation (example: grandfather died of pancreatic cancer last December and I had those types of nightmares prior to his passing).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 4 3 3 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I would definitely think this occurrence is due to factors outside the normal human experience. Maybe something in my subconscious had connected with that family member, or maybe God (or something else) had blessed me with the compassionate opportunity to connect with that loved one one last time before death.

{"prompt":"I would want to believe that this happened for a reason, and that this person was trying to share this knowledge with me before they passed away. Though, I tend to have a difficult time believing in spiritual things such as these. For this reason, I am likely to think that this just happened by coincidence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I have no idea how or why this would happen. I know that when items like this have happened with my family members previously, my mom attributes it to her deceased father coming to visit and \"help\" us. I am not sure if I believe this, because I am not a very \"spiritual\" person, but if it were true and love ones who have passed away can say hello and provide help in a time of need that would be a good thing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 5 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't believe in the supernatural, so I think I would be very shook up by it. I would try to rationalize it in some way, for example, maybe I was thinking about them that night, or maybe someone had mentioned them to me during the day, and that somehow influenced my dream. But, I think that if that truly happened, it would really make me question my lack of belief in the supernatural.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I would be conflicted; on one hand, I would think it was possible that this person had been able to supernaturally reach out to me, but because I have no way to actually prove it, I don't think I would fully believe it. Sometimes, people have experiences that are coincidental, and one event does not make a pattern. It is more likely that this person was on my mind and therefore appeared in my dream rather than the appeared through supernatural means.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 4 3 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't particularly believe in supernatural things, but I also don't believe in weird coincidences so I feel like it might've actually been them saying that.

Maybe it would just be a weird coincidence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 5 5 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I would think this happened by accident, since I don't see why those two things would logically be related. At the same time, I would be quite shocked and obviously react very emotionally, so having had that dream might be comforting in some way.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1 2 5 3\n"}

{"prompt":"I think that we can sense when loved ones are in need or in trouble if we pay attention. I believe that can come in the form of physical sensing or in dreams, as in this scenario. The tricky part is that I think we don't often recognize it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 4 5 5\n"}
{"prompt":"I think this owuld be a sign that they are trying to comunicate prior to passing. I often believe we have an internal mechanism to sense when things may happen. This would mean that they are syaing goodbye to you prior to their passing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 6 5 4 7 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Part of me thinks this is just your brain generating data that perceive to be a dream when you wake up. Another part of me thinks the loved one's soul lives on after they die in some metaphysical or supernatural realm and actually are communicating with you. I think both alternatives could be true and don't have to be mutually exclusive.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 5 5 5 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I have no proofs to what I believe, but I believe that people can share thoughts and feelings from distance, like a type of communication at a deeper level. I don`t think that it is active all the time, but at times when emotions are intense, it can be more active or maybe emotions make me feel that way. Pretty hard to explain.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 6 4 6 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I do believe in an afterlife, and after departing, I think that that loved one's essence made an effort to visit you before going on to do whatever it is that you do in the afterlife. I think perhaps they stopped by to give life advice so that you can better enjoy the short time you have here on earth.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 7 6 7 7 5\n"}
{"prompt":"I would think that happened because maybe I knew they weren't doing so well and they were on my mind and in turn triggered a dream about them. It could also happen because of random brain activity in my dreams. Or when I wake up and learn the news they died I compile a different interpretation of the dream the night before to include them in it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 4 3 4 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I don't necessarily believe in a connection between dreams and reality or hidden messages. I have never personally experienced this so it is challenging to way in on. My current understanding of dreams is that we don't fully know why they happen or contain certain content, so I would say the how this happened is largely unknown. In terms of why something like that would happen, I would take it as a sign that I need to be more present with and for the loved ones in my live.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 5 4\n"}
{"prompt":"Sometimes I think this might be like a persons \"sixth sense,\" like their loved ones visiting them, but most likely it's just coincidence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 4 4\n"}
{"prompt":"This actually happens frequently, when I dream a loved one dies. I think this happens because our mind is trying to reassure us of something we need to hear, or imagine that the loved one would tell us. I also think that this could be related to a higher power, and occur to bring peace moving forward.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 5 4 5 6 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I have no clue how this would have happened, but I would have felt extremely overwhelmed. I imagine I might have experienced some guilt from not having communicated with this far-away loved one for quite some time. It could also have been anxiety-induced if I was aware of an illness or another event that may have led to their passing.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 5 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I don't see myself as having any intuition, but I have friends who have had things like this happen and I believe it's real. Since I'm a Christian, I believe that God speaks through dreams for some people - since it happened in the Bible.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 7 6 7 7 4\n"}
{"prompt":"I think this happened because I subconsciously knew that the person would die soon, and I wanted to have one last meaningful communication with the person. Also, it is realistically difficult to meet and talk with the person. My desire to reach out led me to have the particular dream .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 5 4\n"}

{"prompt":"I've never been an extremely or even mildly spiritual person but I have had experiences where I've been on trips abroad and just 'known' something had happened back home-both times this occurred, a grandparent had passed away.

{"prompt":"I wouldn't be sure why this happened. I think at first I would see it as a coincidence, however it is hard to not think that a dream such as that wouldn't have deeper meaning.

{"prompt":"I have had dreams about my deceased grandparents, but it was always years after their deaths.

{"prompt":"I believe the sub-conscious is an amazing thing. Somehow, our minds are in tune with things of which we may not be consciously aware. It is possible that I had been anticipating the eventual death of this loved one and the dream was my mind preparing itself for what was to come. Part of me wants to believe that we have a sixth sense that picks up on spiritual frequencies, but I just don't know.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 4 4 4 5 4\n"}

{"prompt":"Not sure how it happened but I would feel like it was an important and real event and that something special occurred. I would appreciate the fact that they \"visited\" and I would probably take everything they said very seriously and always remember whatever they told me.

{"prompt":"I think this happened because the loved one was on my mind, even subconsciously and it was a way for me to learn from them even though I wasn't near them in body, but I was near them in spirit.

{"prompt":"I think that this dream would have happened because I believe there is a connection we have with our loved ones. I would think this happened by our loved one's spirit coming to us as they were departing this earthly life to tell us goodbye and to remind us that we are loved by them even when they are no longer here on earth.

When my oldest daughter was six months old my grandmother passed away and I was unable to attend the funeral as I lived in Maryland at the time and my extended family was in North Carolina.

I thought I was alone in the house and my grandmother came out of the bathroom. I said to her that she was not supposed to be there because she was dead. She said she knew she was dead, but did not care, she wanted to see the baby. She picked up my daughter and held her and made her laugh.
