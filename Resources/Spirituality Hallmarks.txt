We define spirituality as the capacity of individuals to stand outside of their immediate sense of time and place to view life from a larger, more objective perspective. This transcendent perspective is one in which a person sees a fundamental unity underlying the diverse strivings of nature and finds a bond with others that cannot be severed, not even by death. Spiritual people recognize a synchronicity to life and develop a sense of commitment to others. Spiritual people believe in the unity and purpose of life. They think that all life is interconnected. Spiritual people believe that we are all responsible to and for each other, both across generations and across communities.
